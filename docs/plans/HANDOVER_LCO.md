# HANDOVER — the LRO

**Written 2026-07-24, updated 2026-07-25, 2026-07-29.** This is the state of the language-resonant oscillator as it actually runs, the connections between its parts, and what is still open. It is written because the main development session for the LRO cannot assume the next one inherits anything but the tree. (The instrument is *akróasys* and the oscillator is the **LRO**; the file keeps its old name because memory and docs point at it.)

> **39 lexicon entries were deleted on 2026-07-26 (`defd42c9`), and the four bare waveforms were folded into `analog_osc` on 2026-07-28 (`56597664`). The library is 28 entries, `lexicon_version` 12.** Everything this document says about 64 instruments, 57 parametrised axes, the 129-axis loudness sweep, the 355-anchor census, the 63-body phase census, and every open item naming `vibraphone`, `waterphone`, `glass`, `struck_glass`, `drum_head`, `noise`, `pink_noise`, `hiss`, `rhodes`, `wurlitzer`, `saw`, `square`, `pulse`, `triangle` was measured on a library that no longer exists. Those passages are kept because the *method* in them is still the method and the traps are still the traps — but a count, a census total or a per-entry figure from before 2026-07-26 is history, not state. §2 says what is there today.
>
> The reason for the deletion is in `CLAUDE.md` → **Instrument Authoring**, and it is the rule that now governs every new entry: a named synthesis method with a source before the first orchestra line, an A/B on disk against a fixed external anchor, one instrument at a time, and no self-scored suite.

The 2026-07-25 pass corrected three things this document previously stated wrongly: the host's clip ceiling, who owns the note-off, and where a note begins in the measuring harness. Those three are in §5, they survived the revert untouched, and they invalidate figures measured before that date.

`docs/LCO_CONCEPT.md` remains authoritative **for the goal, the architecture and the invariants**. Its description of *the current code* has gone stale in specific, listed ways — see §7. Read the concept document first; then read §7 of this one before believing any file name in it.

---

## 1. What runs today

**One prompt → one inference against the curated library → the model WRITES one Csound orchestra → it runs.** There is no fallback: no author model, no oscillator. Nothing is prefabricated, nothing is selected from a menu, and nothing outside the emitted Csound shapes the sound.

The path, end to end:

| Step | Where |
|---|---|
| The user types a prompt and hits Generate | `src/gui/PromptPanel.cpp` |
| `mode=csound` request over the stdin/stdout IPC | `src/inference/PipeInference.cpp` → `docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md` |
| The author backend is chosen — external API, local GGUF, or local transformers | `backend/pipe_inference.py` `_resolve_author_backend` → `_resolve_coder_model_dir` |
| The single model surface is built (`csound_llm`, `accepts_messages = True`) | `backend/pipe_inference.py`, csound branch |
| The author reads the index and names what it wants opened | `backend/lco_write.py` `_consult` → `named_entries` → `open_entries` |
| Those entries' Csound is handed over, the model writes, the compiler judges | `backend/lco_write.py` `build_csound_response` |
| The orchestra is compiled and run live | `src/dsp/CsoundEngine.cpp` |

`build_csound_response` returns `{ok, orchestra, params_text, reading, thinking, consultation, repairs, attempts, author_model}`. `params_text` is the authored body; `orchestra` is that body inside the host scaffold; `consultation` is `{named, opened, library_size}` — what the AUTHOR asked for and what was actually put in front of it (the same set, unless no instrument was recognised: then the whole library is opened, and the two must stay distinguishable or the panel reads a full `opened` back as "the author chose nothing"); `repairs` is the list of Csound errors the body had to be repaired past. The LCO panel's trace (HEARD / OPENED / WROTE / REPAIRED / RUNNING) is fed from those last two — `tools/lco_trace_wire_check.py` is what proves they survive the wire.

### The host scaffold — the only contract the model has to meet

`lco_write.wrap()` puts the authored body inside a fixed host. The body's single obligation is to write its output into **`asig`**. Everything else is provided:

- `sr` from the host, `ksmps = 64`, `nchnls = 16` (`== CsoundEngine::kMaxVoices`), `0dbfs = 1`
- ftables `giSine` (1), `giCos` (2, a **cosine** table — `gbuzz`'s harmonics are cosines), `giCheb` (3, a GEN13 odd-harmonic transfer function), `giImp` (4, a strike impulse for models whose strike argument is a table number)
- one numeric `instr 1` with `ivoice = p4`, sixteen always-on voice instances, per-voice channels `gate/freq/vel/pres/timb/trig`
- `kfreq limit kfreqraw, 20, 12000`; `koct1/2/3` and `kvol1/2/3` from the player's knobs
- `knote` — seconds since **this** note, reset on `changed2(ktrig)`, `init 0` (a note already gated high at the first k-cycle gives `changed2` no edge, so any other starting value would freeze)
- `aout = asig * kgate * kpresGain * HEADROOM` (0.32), then `clip aout, 0, 0.95, 0.85` — whose real ceiling is **2.523 transparent / 2.746 absolute** in body units, not `0.95/0.32` (§5). `kvel` was removed from this line 2026-07-25 (BJ): the voice envelope's peak already tracks velocity, so the extra factor made the LRO scale as vel² where every other engine is linear; presets saved before that date carry the old line in their stored orchestra text until re-baked

**The voices are always on.** There is no score event per note; a note is an edge in `ktrig`, and the release is `kgate portk kgateraw, 0.001` in the host — measured 6.98 ms to −40 dB, identical at every body setting (§5). So the body can neither be one-shot excited nor own a decay: every struck instrument in the library is continuously driven (noise, `dust`), the synth owns the envelope, and the oscillator is a spectrum source (`LCO_CONCEPT.md` §4). An idiom whose decay *is* the model cannot stand under this scaffold.

---

## 2. The library, and how to curate it

`backend/dco_lexicon.json` (`lexicon_version` **12** as of 2026-07-29) is the curated source of truth: **28 instruments, 51 adjectives, 17 motions**, every instrument with working Csound. All 28 ship — nothing is withheld at the moment, though the `withheld` mechanism is still in `tools/lco_build_library.py` (its value is the REASON, not a boolean) and is the way to take an entry out of the author's view without deleting its measured constants.

The 28, and where each came from:

| | |
|---|---|
| **23 inherited** — machine-harvested from the parked emitters, ear-approved before that | `additive` `bass_saw` `brass` `cheby` `chiptune` `clarinet` `cymbal` `drum_head` `flute` `fm` `fm_bell` `fm_ep` `harpsichord` `metallic_fm` `organ` `ring_mod` `sine` `string` `strings` `struck_bar` `sub_sine` `sync` `theremin` |
| **1 inherited and rebuilt** since the revert | `supersaw`, rebuilt 2026-07-28 (`0e38d3dd`) on Szabo's published measurements of the JP-8000 |
| **3 built since the revert**, each under the Instrument Authoring rules | `blown_bottle`, `driven_metal` (2026-07-26), `plucked_wire` (Karplus-Strong / Jaffe-Smith, 2026-07-26/27) |
| **`analog_osc`**, which absorbed the four bare waveforms | `saw` `square` `pulse` `triangle` are no longer entries: `56597664` folded them in, restoring the decision `85807cb3` had already made — `analog_osc`'s `wave` axis owns them. A prompt saying "sawtooth" reaches `analog_osc` at `wave` 0 / `width` 0.02. |

**11 of the 28 carry parameters**: `analog_osc` `blown_bottle` `driven_metal` `drum_head` `fm` `fm_bell` `fm_ep` `metallic_fm` `plucked_wire` `string` `supersaw`. The other 17 are fixed idioms and the audit says so as `S1` rather than as a defect.

An instrument entry carries

- `key` and **surface forms** — the words that reach it. Validation canon; the model never sees them.
- `why` — what the model *does* see.
- `code` — real, working Csound against the scaffold above.
- optionally `params`: each with a measured `range`, a `default`, and **named anchors with a perceptual gloss** (`bow=1.0 (bowed: drawn with a bow: standing, breathing, the top rubbed off)`).
- optionally `anchor_code` — the same instrument rendered at each anchor of its character axis, so the model can see which numbers move with which word.

`tools/lco_build_library.py` assembles the lexicon into `backend/lco_library.json`, which is what `lco_write.render_library()` turns into the author's prompt. `--check` regenerates in memory and fails on drift, so the two cannot silently fall out of step.

**Curating an instrument means editing the lexicon.** The inherited instruments did not start life hand-written: their Csound was machine-harvested **once** from the parked implementation's own emitters (tag `parked/keys-path-csound-20260721`), whose constants were measured and ear-approved, so the library inherited every idiom the old path could produce rather than a smaller vocabulary wearing its name. That harvest is finished and its result is in the lexicon verbatim. **Do not revive the tag to rebuild the library** — a new instrument has nowhere to live in an emitter that never had it, and the build stopped depending on a deleted file (commit `73f91857`, which proved byte-identity of the harvest against the committed library before baking it in).

**And do not add an instrument the way the 2026-07-25/26 batch was added.** That is now `CLAUDE.md` → **Instrument Authoring**, six numbered rules, each independently blocking. The short form: name the synthesis method and its source in writing *before* the first orchestra line; render `nearest_existing.wav` from the closest entry the library already has *before* writing the new body; the acceptance criterion is BJ hearing that A/B on disk, never a self-built meter; one instrument at a time with a fixed attempt budget; enter through the physical models this Csound actually ships (`wgbow`, `wgflute`, `wgclar`, `wgpluck2`, `barmodel`, `mode`, `streson`, `marimba`, `vibes`, the PhISEM particle set), not through the `fm*` toy tier. Two absences are measured on this machine and are not to be re-litigated: the STK opcodes are not installed, and Faust is a trap — `faustcompile` returns −1 with no diagnostic and an `import("stdfaust.lib")` **segfaults the host process**.

### Which instruments carry parameters, and where they stand

Every axis in the library is a **measured** range with named anchors, gated by `tools/lco_param_audit.py` (§4): the audit's own counts move with every batch, so run it rather than quoting it. It exits 2 on a key it does not have instead of printing an empty clean pass.

**Run on 2026-07-29 over all 28 entries, the tool's own headline: 43 measured findings, 14 could not be measured, 6 declared properties.** Counting the printed codes instead gives 17 × `S1`, 14 × `S4`, 15 × `M5`, 6 × `M4`, 5 × `M3`, 4 × `M7`, 2 × `M2` — 63 lines, which the headline buckets differently, so quote one or the other and not a mixture. Which of it is real work:

- **17 × `S1` "no parameters at all"** — the fixed idioms listed above. Not defects; that list is the growth axis of the library, and `LCO_CONCEPT.md` §1 is what it is for: „Parametrisierungshinweise wie 'square ist sharp wenn Wert x = y, ist hollow wenn x = y'".
- **14 axes have no `anchor_code`**, each reported twice (once as `S4`, once as `M5`) — an axis the author is told about in words and never shown as code. `string`'s `damp` and `pick` are two of them.
- **4 × `M7` register tilt** — `driven_metal` is the worst at **8.2 dB across 110–880 Hz (−2.72 dB/octave)** against 0.0 dB of render-to-render scatter, and `drum_head` reads −2.99 dB/octave. Loudness following the keyboard is a real defect on a new entry.
- **6 × `M4` "stands still"** — among them `sub_sine` (6.3 Hz at coherence 1.0), `bass_saw` (1.3 Hz), and `string` (1613.9 Hz at coherence 0.233, which is the incoherence class, not stillness).
- **The one `M5` that is a loudness finding rather than a missing exemplar** — `blown_bottle`'s `blow` moves loudness 1.21 dB over its travel, against a 1.0 dB bound.
- **`analog_osc` is clean at 220 Hz**: centroid 2180.0, tilt −0.0 dB/octave, no finding of any code. Its two `; LOUDNESS:` declarations are why — before them the audit read `wave` and `width` as volume faders at 5.89 and 4.75 dB.

**Only one body in the library decays at all today**: `plucked_wire`, which declares `; DECAY: SELF` and reads tail/head 0.002 at 220 Hz. Everything else holds level to within 6 dB, because the host owns the note-off and the bodies were written knowing it (§5). So the strike meter applies to one entry; everything else is judged on the note. `tools/lco_meter_sweep.py` still exists and still picks the meter per body — its 2026-07-25 run over 61 entries and 129 axes is history, but the classification rule it implements is not.

### What the author gets to see — the consultation, BUILT 2026-07-24

**The rule (BJ, 2026-07-24, standing): it is strictly forbidden to constrain the LLM deterministically, in any form.**

The old code violated it. `select(prompt)` matched the prompt's words against the surface forms and **decided by word comparison which library entries the author was allowed to see**; a prompt that matched nothing got a fixed default set (`_STARTER`: saw, pwm, fm_bell, additive, struck_bar), capped at `_MAX_INSTRUMENTS` (8). It never blocked the writing and never picked the sound — the author wrote either way — but it did deterministically decide the orientation, with exactly the holes a word matcher has: `bell` hit, `bells` did not, German nothing.

**BJ's own words for the replacement (2026-07-24):**

> „Es geht eine Liste mit Instrumenten und sonischen Beschreibungen der Parameter in den Prompt. Thinking wird dann nicht-deterministisch entscheiden was im nächsten Zug dem LLM aus der Bibliothek zur Verfügung gestellt wird."

Two turns, and both are one authoring of one sound:

1. The system prompt carries **the index** (`render_index`) — every entry, what it is, and what its parameters do sonically (the `why` line and the anchor glosses: `string` → `bow` "bowed: drawn with a bow: standing, breathing, the top rubbed off", `pick`, `damp`). No Csound. It was **26 965 characters, ~6.7k tokens** on 2026-07-24 with 98 entries — about what the old 8-entry word-matched excerpt cost. With 131 entries and 42 parametrised it is **113 019 characters, ~28k tokens** (2026-07-25). It is still a stable prefix, so it caches, but it is no longer small, and the whole library is 295 483 characters — the index is now 38 % of what it was meant to be a cheap table of contents for. That is open item 6.
2. `_consult()` asks the author to think about what the sound IS and name what it wants opened. `named_entries()` reads its reply, `open_entries()` fetches exactly those, `_writing_turn()` hands their real Csound over as the next user turn in the same conversation. **Python decides nothing** — it recognises the names the model used. A reply that names nothing opens the WHOLE library; there is no default set any more.

The curated code exists in order to be seen; the question was only *when*, and the answer is "in turn two, chosen by the author". The surface forms stop being a routing layer over the user's prompt and remain what they always were underneath: the lexicon's validation canon, now also how Python recognises what the author asked for.

Consequences, all landed: the panel station is **OPENED**, not LOOKED UP — it lists what the author asked for and says so, and when the author named nothing it says the whole library was opened rather than printing 98 chips as if they had been chosen. The reasoning now arrives in the consultation, which streams as **`attempt: 0`** (§4.6 of `docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md`); the writing turn is asked not to reason twice, so on a first-try authoring no reasoning frame ever arrives under attempt 1.

To see what the author asked for on a given prompt, read `consultation.opened` in the answer — e.g. from `tools/lco_author_offline.py --out …`.

## 3. The author, and the repair loop

The author is **gemma-4-12B QAT 4-bit GGUF via llama.cpp** (`~/Library/T5ynth/models/coder/gemma-4-12b-it-qat-q4_0`), greedy (`temperature 0.0`), **`max_tokens=-1`** — no invented output cap; a number there cuts an orchestra off mid-line. `n_ctx` 65536, overridable by `T5YNTH_CODER_N_CTX`. Since 2026-07-22 the same model also does translation and re-prompt; the separate 1.5B translator is gone.

**The author does not have to be local.** `_resolve_author_backend` (`backend/pipe_inference.py`) prefers an **external API** whenever the request carries the fields for one, and only then falls back to `local_gguf` / `local_transformers`. `backend/author_api.py` speaks OpenAI-compatible HTTP and Anthropic; the provider list is taken 1:1 from the same table the rest of the lab uses. This matters when reading any measurement below: **a figure from "the author" is a figure from ONE model.** BJ runs a different one than the offline harness does, and the same prompt writes different Csound on each — the 2026-07-29 `analog_osc` end-to-end (§5) is the worked example, where the local 12B and BJ's own model disagreed about whether the width moved.

**The re-prompt now listens instead of quoting** (`75342d98`, 2026-07-29). It used to build its stance turn from the READING line the author wrote *about its own code* — a self-description that made sense when the lexicon was closed and pre-heard, and means nothing once the Csound is written freely. It now renders a bare probe of the authored orchestra and lets CLAP describe it, the same ear and the same labels the neural panel uses. Two rates, both needed: the probe RENDERS at host rate × the LRO oversampling factor (the engine compiles the same text there, and a body may derive its partial count or FM index from `sr`), and is HEARD at the host rate through the engine's own halfband stages, because the backend computes its spectral words against absolute Hz thresholds. Measured on an alias-rich saw stack: centroid 6766 Hz decimated, 28384 Hz at 192 kHz raw, 8474 Hz for the old 1× probe — that gap is the aliasing. There is **no fallback to the author's reading when the ear cannot run**: that would put a claim under a label saying the instrument was heard.

The loop: one inference writes the body, the compiler judges it, and a failure goes back to the model with Csound's own error, up to `MAX_TRIES` (6, `T5YNTH_LCO_MAX_TRIES`). Four properties of it are load-bearing and were each measured into place:

1. **A repair CONTINUES the attempt.** `_continue()` returns `[user, assistant, user]` — the request, the author's own failed answer, the compiler's complaints — so the model edits what it wrote instead of writing the whole sound again from nothing. It keeps the instrument and the movement it already chose, and **the reasoning paragraph it produced the first time stays the answer** (`first_thinking`) rather than being regenerated on every attempt. This requires `llm.accepts_messages = True` on the model surface; a surface without it still works — `_flatten_turn` folds the list back into one user turn — and loses only the KV-cache reuse.
2. **Every distinct error seen so far is shown, not just the latest.** A single-error view makes the author oscillate: told to fix line A it rewrites and breaks line B, told to fix B it reintroduces A, and at temperature 0 that is a permanent 2-cycle no number of retries escapes. Measured on `bright tone -> dark growl`: 6/6 attempts alternating between an inline-`poscil` body and a bare-`atone` one.
3. **An identical reply with no new error stops the loop.** Same conversation in, same output out; the remaining attempts cannot differ, they can only cost. Measured on `accordeon > guitar`: attempts 3 to 6 were the same reply four times.
4. **A mechanical hint on the mechanical mistake.** `_mechanical_hint` recognises `var = opcode arg…` and says so in the model's own terms — Csound's complaint about brackets is a *consequence* of that `=`, and a model told "bracket problem" rewrites the arguments forever.

Python never writes Csound. It names the compiler's complaints; the model writes every fix.

---

## 4. How anything gets measured

Two tools, both committed 2026-07-24, both new — before them there was nothing in `tools/` that drove the shipped author or rendered a body with a meter that had been checked.

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_measure.py --selftest
```

**Run this before believing any number.** It renders signals whose answer is known — pure sine, saw, a gbuzz stack, a *missing* fundamental (energy only at 2f and 3f), white noise, a comb — and asserts the meter returns them, refuses to invent a pitch for noise, and treats silence, non-finite samples and a body the host's clip would act on as errors rather than results. Then:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_measure.py --key string --anchor bowed
```

renders any library entry (or `--anchor` variant, or `--body file`) through a scaffold **derived from `lco_write`'s own `_HEAD`/`_TAIL` by asserted substitution**, so a rename in the host fails the harness loudly instead of quietly measuring a different instrument. It reports pitch in cents, spectral centroid, RMS, p99.9 peak, `peak_late`, sustain, comb contrast, per-harmonic levels, and **colour travel over the note at two window lengths**.

**Three things about that harness are load-bearing and were wrong until 2026-07-25.**

- **Headroom is judged on `peak_late` — the peak after the first `ONSET_S = 0.050` s — against the host's real ceilings** (`HOST_TRANSPARENT = 2.523`, `HOST_CLIP = 2.746`; §5). The percentile is the right size for *dimensioning* a gain, but the host clips on the true peak, so the guard cannot use p99.9; and the true peak of the whole render condemns any body whose first k-cycles start from zero under `balance`, which the plugin never hears. Both errors were live: the percentile let `ice` through, the true peak condemned `string` and `ice` for a start-up transient.
- **`--preroll` reproduces the host's note-start, and without it two whole classes measure wrongly.** The host scores sixteen always-on instances (`i 1 0 360000 …`) and signals a note through `ktrig`/`kgate`, with `knote init 0` reset by `changed2(ktrig)`. The harness used to score `i 1 0 dur 1` with `ktrig = 1` constant, so the instance *began* at the note. Anything whose reading depends on how long the instance has been running reads a fiction: `balance`, whose RMS denominator starts at zero (`string` reads 3.179 at t = 4.4 ms with `balance`, 0.622 with a fixed gain), and every free-running k-rate LFO, whose phase at note-on is the plugin's uptime. `--preroll` runs the instance before the edge and trims at the k-period boundary (`preroll_edge()`, not `int(preroll*SR)` — the selftest asserts bit-identity from sample 64 across five prerolls).
- **Pitch on an inharmonic set is `tracking()`, never `f0` or the loudest partial.** A bell, a bar, a glass or a gourd has no partial at the played frequency; asking for one produces a confident wrong number and a bug report. The valid question is whether the whole spectrum *transposes* with the note: correlate a 110→880 Hz glide against a fixed reference. Measured `tracks` for `mbira` (r_note 0.64 / r_fixed −0.03), `struck_bar` (0.77), `handpan` (0.717), `fm_bell` (0.828), `glass` (0.493), waterphone (0.675/−0.042).

**The harness renders at 44100 and the plugin no longer does.** Since `5e65c0d4` the plugin compiles Csound at `sampleRate × factor` (1/2/4, user-set in Settings since `667d8bea`) and decimates per voice with a 63-tap halfband, so `%SR%` in a body resolves to the *oversampled* rate. Everything in §5 was measured at 1×. Aliasing verdicts from this harness are therefore a worst case, and anything that depends on the decimator belongs in `tools/audition_lro_oversampling.cpp`, not here — there is deliberately no Python decimator.

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_author_offline.py --corpus <file> --out run.json --measure
```

drives the **real** author over a whole corpus in one process — the exact call the csound branch of `pipe_inference` makes one line after resolving the model, `accepts_messages` and all — recording per prompt the attempts, the errors repaired past, the body, the reading, what the words reached, and the seconds each inference took. With `--measure` each compiled body is rendered and its movement signature recorded. It is a measurement harness, not a wire test; `tools/lco_trace_wire_check.py` is what proves the IPC path carries the result, and `tools/lco_sanitize_gate.py` guards the prose/code split in the reply.

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_param_audit.py            # every instrument, every axis
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_axis_probe.py --body cand.csd --all --gate
```

`lco_param_audit.py` (2026-07-25) turns `LCO_CONCEPT.md` §3 and §4 into checks that fail out loud: four structural ones read from the library with no render (parameters exist; each axis has a range, an in-range default, ≥2 named anchors with a perceptual gloss, a `note`, and `anchor_code` variants naming axes that exist), and seven rendered ones through the calibrated meter — renders clean at 55/220/1760 Hz, **tracks** the keyboard across them, stands without self-decay, **moves**, each axis is a colour control and not a volume fader (the failure that already shipped once), each axis actually does something measurable, and the keyboard itself is not a volume control. Findings that are legitimate get a **named exemption inside the tool**, with the reason, rather than an explanation in a commit message nobody will read next to the number. `lco_axis_probe.py --gate` is the same set of questions asked of a *candidate* body before it enters the lexicon.

**Why the movement reading matters, and why one window length is not enough.** Movement by default is a platform fundamental, and a corpus of standing tones passes an implementation that cannot move at all — that is exactly how a static-partial reimplementation once certified itself green while pwm, morph and dirt were silently gone. `pwm`'s duty sweep reads 48 Hz of travel in 0.5 s windows (a full LFO cycle per window, averaged flat) and 696 Hz in 31 ms ones; a standing sine reads 0 at every window length, which is what makes the fast reading evidence rather than noise. Both are reported.

### The parity corpus — how a rewrite is stopped from moving its own target

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_width_parity.py --out <dir> --rev <commit before the rewrite>   # freeze
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_width_parity.py --out <dir> --check                             # after
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_width_ab.py     --out <dir> --rev <commit>                       # WAVs, both sides, one common gain
```

Built 2026-07-29 for the `analog_osc` width rewrite; the **shape** is the general tool, and `CLAUDE.md` → Migration & Substrate Discipline requires it whenever a capability moves house. Four properties, each of which was wrong in the first version and cost a measured defect:

- **The corpus is stated in SOUNDS, not in the vocabulary of either implementation.** Six of them here — `triangle`, `saw`, `square`, `pulse_narrow`, `pulse_wide`, `pwm_moving` — read out of the entry's own `anchor_code` blocks by a `cases()` that understands both the old schema and the new one. A corpus synthesised from the new vocabulary inherits the new implementation's blind spot by construction.
- **`--rev` re-measures the OLD entry with TODAY's instrument.** When the meter is corrected the reference has to be re-taken from the old body, never re-taken from the new one — that is how a new behaviour quietly becomes its own target.
- **Every quantity that matters is compared, not merely computed.** Centroid 5 %, odd/even 3 dB, rms 0.5 dB, duty-travel span 2 dB. The first version computed the duty track and the level and then compared neither, so a sweep cut from 0.6 to 0.4 — a 60 % loss of the one quantity the corpus exists to protect — printed `ok`.
- **A `--check` run must not write.** It used to render the WAVs unconditionally, so every check overwrote the very reference it was checking against.

**And the window length is part of the meter, not a detail.** A duty that moves shows up as odd/even travelling over the note, and it has to be read in **0.15 s windows**: a third of a 4 s note is 1.2 s, and anything above about 1 Hz averages out inside one. Measured on one body at 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 Hz, thirds read ~1.1 dB for all four. `lco_measure.odd_even_db` takes no window at all, so the bounds have to be handed to `partials` as `t0`/`t1` — slicing the array instead leaves its default 0.5–3.5 s in place and silently discards the front of every window.

**What no duty reading can separate is the LFO from `age`.** At `age` 0.35 a *standing* square reads 10.2 dB of odd/even travel, because the width jitter drifts slowly through the neighbourhood of 0.5 where odd/even is steepest; at `age` 0 the same square reads 0.6 and a moving width still reads 9.9. So a duty span is a comparison against a frozen row at the same `age`, never a verdict on its own — which is why `tools/lco_width_e2e.py` prints numbers and the author's code and offers no verdict at all.

### The question none of the above asks — 2026-07-26

Every meter listed so far measures a body **against itself**: loudness spread across its own axis, headroom against the host's ceiling, movement across its own note, partial levels relative to its own fundamental. All of them are satisfied by a body that is internally consistent and *not the instrument it is named after*. Measured on 2026-07-25, three entries were green on every one of them and wrong: `vibraphone` was a decaying sine (×4 partial 34 dB down, half-life 0.30 s), `rain` sat 1.6 dB from plain `noise`, `crackle` 1.9 dB. BJ heard the first from outside the numbers and said so. A green suite over the wrong question reads as proof, which makes it worse than no suite.

**The rule that follows (BJ, 2026-07-26):** an entry is finished when it has been held next to a real recording of its instrument — a real WAV, or one generated with SA3 — or it is not built at all. The library's own bounds are not a substitute.

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_reference.py generate --keys vibraphone,flute --n 4
.venv/bin/python tools/lco_reference.py compare  --keys vibraphone,flute
```

`generate` writes SA3 references into `tools/lco_reference_out/<key>/`; a real recording dropped into the same folder is read identically. `compare` renders the **whole library** and asks one question: against that reference, where does the body that *claims* the name rank? Absolute similarities from a pretrained model are not interpretable — a rank among 69 candidates is. If `struck_bar` sits closer to a real vibraphone than `vibraphone` does, the claim is not carried by the sound. Two distances are reported side by side and never averaged: a CLAP audio-embedding cosine (hears the whole character, including the room and the performance a bare oscillator has none of) and a pitch-robust spectral-envelope distance (cepstrally liftered log spectrum on a log-frequency grid, level-normalised — resonance structure only). A disagreement between them is the finding, not a number to split.

**The automatic ranking does NOT calibrate, and the tool says so rather than quietly reporting it.** With the references fixed (see the `alpha` trap below) they separate cleanly from one another — 29 of 32 clips' nearest neighbour is their own instrument on the CLAP leg, 25 of 32 on the spectral one, within-instrument better than between on both. But asked which of the 70 bodies sits closest to a real flute, the meter puts the library's own `flute` **26th on CLAP and 57th on the spectrum**; `cymbal` 7th and 25th, `organ` 20th and 41st, `harpsichord` 38th and 47th. Every entry is 20–39 dB from every reference while the library's own best is 8–12 dB, which is the signature of a distance dominated by *how recording-like* a signal is, not by *which instrument* it is. The controls fail, so no rank for `vibraphone` or `waterphone` from this leg is evidence about them — reporting one would be the same mistake one layer up. Harmonic-partial descriptors were tried instead and are not usable either: on real recordings the f0 estimate takes octave errors (an SA3 vibraphone reference reads partial 2 at +49 dB, i.e. f0 detected an octave low), and a partial vector built on a wrong f0 is confident nonsense.

**What works is `pairs`.** It writes the entry's own renders — 110/220/440 Hz, 6 s, scaled by `HEADROOM` so the level is what the plugin puts out — into the same folder as the references, named so the filename says which is which. BJ hears them side by side; that was the instruction. For an objective gate, the usable criterion is the physics rather than a recording: published partial ratios and levels, decay times, and whether the mechanisms the instrument needs are present at all. That is what the `vibraphone` rebuild is being held to.

Two mechanical traps, both hit on the first run and both now guarded in the tool:

- **The reference prompt must not say "no music".** The backend picks `TrackType: Instrument` vs `Music` with a string classifier (`_looks_like_music`) that matches the words *music* / *drums* / *percussion* and understands no negation, so a prompt asking for no music is routed to Music. The first reference generated here came back as an arrangement for exactly that reason. `lco_reference.py` re-resolves the prefix per key and refuses the key rather than generating an arrangement.
- **CLAP cannot be read as a text judge of these renders, and `tools/lco_resemblance.py` refuses to let it.** Asked which of the 69 bodies best matches the caption for its own name, the two checkpoints that pass the backend's sanity gate disagree almost completely — `laion/clap-htsat-unfused` puts cymbal #2, organ #18, flute #6, harpsichord #28, thunder #3, cricket #51; `laion/larger_clap_music_and_speech` puts cymbal #18, organ #3, flute #24, harpsichord #4, thunder #12, cricket #45. Where one is right the other is wrong. The cause is the domain gap: these are dry, roomless, performerless single notes at three fixed pitches, nothing like the recordings CLAP was trained on. The tool runs a control set whose identity is not in doubt and **refuses to report the rest of the ranking when the controls fail** — a ranking from a meter that puts a cricket 51st out of 69 for "the sound of a cricket" is not evidence about a waterphone. (A third cached checkpoint, `laion/larger_clap_music`, fails the backend's own sanity gate outright — text-text 1.000, every similarity 0.006, a collapsed text tower — and is excluded by name so it cannot vote silently.)

## 5. Measured facts — do not re-derive these

Csound 6.18, Homebrew, double precision, no STK.

Many of the entry names below (`vibraphone`, `waterphone`, `glass`, `rhodes`, `pink_noise`, `handpan`, `bagpipe`, …) were deleted on 2026-07-26. **The facts are kept because the fact is about the SUBSTRATE or the METER, and the entry was only the thing it was measured on.** Read a name here as "the body that showed this", not as a body you can render today.

**The host scaffold — what a body can never own** (all measured 2026-07-25 through `lco_write`'s own `_TAIL`)

- **The clip ceiling is 2.523 transparent / 2.746 absolute in body units, not `0.95 / HEADROOM` = 2.969.** The voice ends on `aout clip aout, 0, 0.95, 0.85`, and in Csound's `clip` with `imeth 0` the FOURTH argument is the fraction of `ilimit` at which limiting *begins* — the curve never reaches 0.95. Ramping 0..3 through that exact line: transparent to 0.78, 0.84 → 0.838393, 0.90 → 0.872578, **≥ 0.96 → 0.878750, rigid, for ever.** So `HOST_TRANSPARENT = 0.85·0.95/HEADROOM = 2.523` and `HOST_CLIP = 0.87875/HEADROOM = 2.746`; with blowing pressure at maximum (`kpresGain = 1 + 0.15·kpres` → 1.15) the transparent bound falls to 2.194. The old constant called fifteen shipped renders clean that the host was already reshaping. `lco_measure._clip_transfer()` re-measures the curve from `_TAIL`'s own arguments in the selftest, because a body's render is `asig` — *upstream* of the clip — so the harness can never observe clipping by rendering a loud body.
- **The host owns the note-off, so a body can never own a ring time.** `kgate portk kgateraw, 0.001` then `aout = asig * kgate * …`: a 1 ms half-time is −40 dB in ~6.6 ms. Measured on `cymbal`, `glass` and `struck_bar` with `ring` at 0.00 / 0.50 / 1.00, gate dropped at t = 2 s: **6.98 / 6.98 / 6.98 ms — identical.** "choked — caught by the hand" and "let ring — a full open wash" are the same release. Such an axis is real, but what it moves is the timbre of the HELD note (comb contrast `glass` 27.6 → 39.0 dB, `struck_bar` 16.5 → 35.5 dB); name it for that.
- **`balance` in a body and a decay in the same body are mutually exclusive.** The AGC pulls the tail back up: a T60 of 3.48 s measures as 5891 s or ∞. Whoever adds `balance` against register tilt cannot afterwards put an envelope in that body.
- **A third thing `balance` costs: the note's start depends on how long the plugin has been open.** Its averager has no note-on reset, so the gain it happens to hold at the edge is a function of uptime. `struck_bar`, `glass`, `cymbal`, `tanpura`, `string` and the FM family all read it; 29 shipped bodies carry a `balance`, and eight of them are ones only this rule made visible (`fm`, `fm_bell`, `fm_ep`, `drum_head`, `metallic_fm`, `struck_bar`, `cymbal`, `glass`). It is REPORTED, not gated: §4 has no rule about it, and the only cure is to key what must happen after the attack to `knote`, which the host does reset.

  ⚠ **There is no per-body ranking for this class, and two attempts at one have now been withdrawn. Do not write a third.** A single grid of four plugin ages gives a number that is a property of the four ages, not of the body: three grids of the same construction read medians 73 / 137 / 107 Hz over the same bodies, `sync` 498 / 1182 / 908, `glass` 67 / 289 / 298 — so the older 303-vs-340 disagreement that was called dead is *inside the spread the grid choice alone produces*. **31 of 63 bodies read 2x apart or more across grids** (`overtone_voice` 4–207, `handpan` 21–182, `free_reed` 22–172, `pink_noise` 132–493). And for a noise-excited body the question cannot be answered by varying the preroll at all, because that varies which noise samples the note gets: the control is to hold the age and change only the seed (`lco_measure.reseed`).

  **What survives is a verdict per body, measured 2026-07-25 by `tools/lco_phase_census.py`** — three grids plus a four-seed control, unrounded, `centroid_audible`:

  - **43 depend on plugin uptime beyond their own noise.** Everything tonal with a slow free-running control: the whole waveform family, the reeds, the FM trio, `string`/`strings`/`supersaw`/`sync`/`tanpura`/`surf`/`wind`, plus `noise` and `hiss`.
  - **11 move, but not separably from the exciter's dice** — `bubbles`, `cymbal`, `drum_head`, `glass`, `handpan`, `ice`, `mbira`, `pink_noise`, `rain`, `struck_bar`, `thunder`. Their seed-only control is at or above their four-age spread. `mbira` 828 and `glass` 67 were both published as uptime figures and are both in this class. Note what this set *is*: the noise-excited resonator banks and the event textures — the same bodies as item 9's second group, and for the same reason.
  - **9 read under 1 Hz on every grid** — `bass_saw`, `brass`, `rhodes`, `sine`, `triangle`, `vibraphone`, `voice_ee`, `voice_oo`, `wurlitzer`.

  Two traps this cost, both now wired into the tool rather than written down. **A body that was not rendered gets no verdict:** the first version printed `free_running`'s skip list as "not uptime-dependent at all" and three of the seven were wrong — `pink_noise` reads 216 Hz, `noise` 250, `hiss` 165, because `free_running`'s `_AGEN` pattern matches no a-rate generator and a bare `anz rand 1.0, 0.5, 1` is invisible to it. It now disagrees with the measurement on **8** bodies and prints which. **And 0.0 Hz was never proof of independence:** `measure()` rounds `centroid_over_note` to whole Hz, which is why `bass_saw` (0.287 Hz) and `voice_ee` (0.117 Hz) once read zero; the census reads `travel()` unrounded, where a true zero (`sine`) is exactly 0.000000.

**Substrate**

- **`gbuzz` normalises to PEAK, not RMS.** Holding a harmonic stack at one loudness while its harmonic count moves needs the closed-form correction `knrm = ((1-kmul^knh)/(1-kmul)) / sqrt((1-kmul^(2*knh))/(1-kmul*kmul)*0.5)`, passed as `0.17 * knrm` in the kamp position.
- **`vco2 imode`: 0 = saw, 2 = pulse/square, 4 = triangle/saw/ramp.** `imode 10` is not triangle — measured, it is another pulse. There is no `vco1`.
- **`kpw` is the SAME quantity on imode 2 and imode 4, and that is the manual's own wording, not an inference**: „the pulse width of the square wave (imode waveform=2) **or the ramp characteristics of the triangle wave** (imode waveform=4)". Range 0–1 on both, anything outside wrapped, not exactly an integer, recommended 0.01–0.99. So one width position drives both generators: on imode 2 the duty (0.5 a square, away from it a pulse), on imode 4 where the ramp breaks (0.5 a triangle, toward either end a sawtooth). The head prompt said "triangle" plainly and omitted the argument until `6ca43ebe`, which hid the capability at the one place the author reads first.
- **The two spectra are one identity, derived and then measured.** The pulse *is* the derivative of the asymmetric triangle — the triangle's slope is constant on each segment, so differentiating gives a rectangle whose duty is exactly the triangle's break fraction — and differentiation multiplies the nth coefficient by n:

      pulse,   duty  d:  |aₙ| ∝ |sin(π n d)| / n
      ramp,    break p:  |aₙ| ∝ |sin(π n p)| / (n² · p(1−p))

  Same numerator, one power of n apart, which is the "1/n versus 1/n², much darker" the head prompt already stated. Three consequences follow with no further assumption, and all three were measured at 220 Hz: `|sin(πn(1−x))| = |sin(πnx)|` exactly, so **x and 1−x are the same magnitude spectrum on both rails** — ramp 0.02/0.98 → 2004.5 / 2004.6 Hz centroid, 0.12/0.88 → 846.2 / 846.1; pulse 0.02/0.98 → 6202.9 / 6202.4, 0.12/0.88 → 4317.1 / 4317.4. **At 0.5 every even n cancels on both** — odd/even 131.3 dB on the ramp, 96.5 on the pulse, at `age` = 0. And as x → 0 the pulse goes flat while the ramp goes 1/n, a saw.
- **Level: the ramp rail is pure colour, the pulse rail is not, and that asymmetry is physics rather than a fader.** Each ramp segment is a full-span linear ramp, so the rms is 1/√3 at every width — measured −9.21 dB at 0.02 / 0.12 / 0.5 / 0.88 / 0.98 alike. On the pulse rail the wave still swings ±A, but a width off 0.5 carries DC `A(2w−1)`, and what is left once that is taken out is `2A√(w(1−w))`: measured −4.45 / −8.22 / −15.73 dB at 0.5 / 0.12 / 0.02, i.e. 3.77 and 11.28 dB down against a predicted 3.74 and 11.06. **A pulse gets quieter the narrower it gets, and that IS pulse width modulation** — `LCO_CONCEPT.md` §4's one-loudness rule constrains an invented second envelope, never the physics (`feedback_rule_purpose_not_threshold`).
- **`kpw` must FOLD at 0 and 1, not wrap.** Same spectrum either way, so the sound travels the same path — but a wrap makes `vco2` jump across its own table discontinuity and emit a lone one-sample spike. Measured over 8 s at full drift depth: 15 spikes wrapping, 0 folding.
- **`balance astr, aref` against a fixed-loudness yardstick** (`aref poscil 0.35, 400`) holds a resonator's level to within 0.01–0.07 dB across every parameter axis *and* the whole pitch range. The analytic `sqrt(1-g²)` law holds only for a *white* exciter; on a shaped one it drifts. **That 0.01–0.07 dB is the STATIONARY level and nothing else** — the commits claiming "the timbre is untouched" are wrong about the attack. First 20 ms relative to the stationary mean, before → after adding `balance`: `glass` −16.5 → **+2.4 dB**, `struck_bar` −13.7 → +3.0, `cymbal` −6.9 → +2.0, `brass` +4.7 → −0.2, `organ` +2.3 → −0.1. It also starts from a zero denominator, which is why headroom is judged after 50 ms.
- **`pluck` is not broken — it is structurally unusable here.** Its decay *is* the model, and the note-off belongs to the host's `portk`, not to the body (above). The viable string is `streson` with a shaped exciter (measured against `pluck`, `wgbow`, `wgpluck`, `wgpluck2`, `repluck`, `wguide1`).
- **A lowpass smear on a scattered exciter kills the instrument's colour** (centroid 4500 → 500 Hz, every parameter axis flattened). Allpass diffusion spreads impulses in time *without* darkening — that is why `string` runs a chain of eight `alpass`, not a `tone`.

**Measurement**

- **The peak of a random-impulse process is itself random** — the same body measured 2.89 on one render and 0.79 on the next. Size gains against p99.9, never the maximum.
- **Which loudness meter is right is a property of the BODY, and getting it wrong has now cost this library in both directions.** `lco_measure.rms_db` integrates a hard-coded 0.5–3.5 s window; a whole-note integral integrates everything; the strike is the first ~100–400 ms. They disagree by more than any bound.
  - **A struck body must be judged on its STRIKE.** `rms_db`'s window opens after **88.98–89.30 %** of the vibraphone's energy has gone (19.16 dB/s), and after ~80 % of the rhodes'. Both had a compensation fitted against that window, both held it to 0.010 dB, and both were *worse than no correction at all* on the audible note: vibraphone `strikepos` 1.700 dB whole-note at 440 Hz against 1.428 uncorrected; rhodes `bark` 1.70 dB whole-note and 2.34 dB at 400 ms against 0.13 and 0.76. Fixed in `5a0f7cca` (refit closed-loop against the whole-note integral) and `a2025a92` (compensation deleted, the raw body was already inside bound).
  - **But a whole-note integral DROWNS a strike whose axis is its decay time.** The struck membrane's `ring` axis reads **106 dB** of whole-note spread — that is the meter measuring how much of a fixed 3 s window is silence after a 0.15 s T60 — while the strike itself holds 0.5 dB.
  - **And the first 100 ms is the wrong meter for anything bowed or blown**, because it is the ring-up, whose level is set by wherever the free-running LFOs happened to be: the waterphone reads 7–11 dB of draw-to-draw variance on the attack meter against 0.1 dB over the note.
  - **So classify, then measure.** The class is itself measurable: render a long note at the defaults and compare the first 200 ms to 4.0–5.5 s. A drop past ~12 dB is a struck body (judge the strike); anything less is sustained (judge the note). Fitting anything against `rms_db` without asking this question is the single most repeated defect in this library.
- **`motion_coherence` fails corners that measurably move MORE than the ones it passes.** The waterphone's `bow = 0` corner reads 0.23–0.35 — straddling the gate's own 0.35 bar, flipping between draws — while over the same note its spectral centroid travels **1.71 octaves** p10–p90 and its level swings 6.9 dB, against 1.11 octaves and 5.8 dB at the default that passes. The meter is looking for a coherent trajectory, and an erratic one is what a waterphone *is*. Do not tune a body to satisfy that number; measure the octave travel and the level swing instead, and record both.
- **"Loudness may travel ≤ 0.5 dB over a note" was never a platform rule.** Shipped instruments measure 1.46 (drum_head) to 6.28 dB (struck_bar) of within-note travel. `LCO_CONCEPT.md` §4 constrains a **parameter axis** — moving a colour control must not move loudness — not a note's life.
- The ways a meter has produced confident wrong numbers on this project (FFT-peak f0 on a comb; autocorrelation octave errors; a render that overflowed; a ceiling read off an opcode's arguments instead of its curve; a note that began with its instance) are all covered by `lco_measure.py --selftest` — 88 cases as of 2026-07-25. That selftest is the calibration; without it the numbers are opinions. **Each new constant goes in with a case that FAILS when the constant is wrong**, not merely one that passes when it is right: the first version of the clip cases stayed green at `HOST_TRANSPARENT × 0.7`, a value that would have condemned `ice` and `bagpipe`.
- **No span bound separates a moving sound from a standing one, and that is asserted as a negative result.** A real sweep travels 959 cents; a static noise bed reads 1005 (`STATIONARY_SPAN_NULL_CENTS`), and a static bed's crest reads 14.55 dB (`STATIONARY_CREST_NULL_DB`). Movement is `span > 60 cents AND motion_coherence > 0.35` — the coherence term is the one doing the work, and anyone tempted to "simplify" the gate to a span threshold has a selftest case waiting.
- **The movement gate has an exemption that is a DECLARATION, not a measurement.** BJ unblocked the event-texture class on 2026-07-25: a body may write `; MOVEMENT: TEXTURE` at the top with its axes, and `lco_param_audit` then *reports* its movement reading instead of failing on it. This exists because no measure separates a rain-like event texture from static noise — so it is deliberately on the author's word. It is the second exemption to movement-by-default and the only one that cannot be verified; keep the count honest (`lco_axis_probe._MOVE_CENSUS`). **Measured 2026-07-29 over the 28 entries: 19 move at all six registers, 9 do not, and NOT ONE carries the declaration** — every body that did was deleted. The constant still says 21 / 12 / 0 and the tool prints `STALE` when it disagrees; §6 item 13.

**The author**

- **The one-line morph template was the single cause of two separate reported defects**: "sine > pwm" rendering as a *static* pulse (b's duty frozen to a constant, with the DC-correction line then reading `- 0.6 * (2 * 0.5 - 1)` — dead code that proves the modulation was dropped), and "harmonic bell > pwm" being read as `+` rather than `>`. Both were fixed by teaching the shape explicitly: each end of a morph is a **whole instrument** with all of its own moving controls, in its own variable, then `kmorph = min(knote / 2.0, 1)` and a crossfade.
- **An `=` written before an opcode is the author's dominant compile failure, and NOTHING in the system prompt has fixed it.** The shape is `asig_b = tone asig_b, 400` — an opcode statement typed as an assignment. Csound answers with a bracket complaint that names neither the `=` nor the opcode, so it is easy to chase for rounds without seeing it. A paragraph was added to `_SYSTEM_HEAD` in `b3bd2b19` to prevent it, telling the author that for a morph "what you take from the library has to be renamed" and that "the line KEEPS ITS EXACT SHAPE". **Measured across `tools/lco_morph_corpus.txt`, 8 prompts, same model, greedy, with and without that paragraph: 7/8 compile either way, and the `=` failure simply moves** — with the paragraph it kills `bright shimmer degrading to a dark rumble` (the prompt BJ reported), without it, `sine > pwm > bell`. The paragraph was neither the cause nor the cure. Do not add another prose rule about it; the two mechanisms that DO act on it are the repair turn's `_mechanical_hint` (which names that exact line after the fact) and the shape of the library's own self-referencing statements (`asig tone asig, 1200`, 32 of them — the one form where result and first argument share a name, so a line reads like an assignment).
- **The mirror slip costs just as much: an assignment written WITHOUT its `=`.** `kbow    0.8` — Csound reads the variable as an opcode name and complains about the number after it ("unexpected NUMBER_TOKEN"), naming neither. Measured 2026-07-24 on `a bowed cello`: the author reproduced the line on the retry and the loop stopped, so the whole authoring was lost to two tokens. `_mechanical_hint` recognises it now. Detection is deliberately narrow — a Csound variable prefix, then nothing but a number to the end of the line; no library line and no scaffold line but `instr 1` has that shape, and the hint is only ever attached to a line the compiler already rejected.
- **A prose instruction to retype library lines is forbidden regardless of its statistics** — it deterministically constrains the author, which the standing rule forbids, and it contradicts the architecture: the model WRITES Csound, it does not transcribe. That is why the paragraph goes, not because the corpus improved.
- **`ok` is not a passing morph.** Removing the paragraph made `bright shimmer degrading to a dark rumble` compile on the first attempt — with the correct structure (`kmorph = min(knote / 2.0, 1)` and one crossfade) and a colour trajectory of 867 → 937 Hz, then flat. It does not degrade. Compile success and the named sonic behaviour are separate measurements, and only the second one answers the prompt. `tools/lco_author_offline.py --measure` reports both; read `centroid_travel_hz` before calling a morph fixed.
- **The class a system-prompt change governs must be in the test set, measured BEFORE the change as well as after.** `b3bd2b19` was validated only afterwards, on four compositional prompts chosen after the fact — none of them a morph carrying adjectives, which is exactly what the paragraph was about. `tools/lco_morph_corpus.txt` is the frozen set for this. Note its limit honestly: greedy decoding has no run-to-run variance, but ANY edit to the system prompt reshuffles every generation, so 8 prompts × 1 run cannot separate "this instruction is harmful" from "the outputs moved". Use it to catch a named prompt regressing, not to certify a prompt change as an improvement.
- Compositional prompts landing first try, measured on the shipped author: `sine > saw + square` (2× `vco2`, a real layer at the far end, 46 s), `accordeon > guitar + bell` (2× `streson`, 2× `foscili`, 16 `alpass`, 105 s), `a bowed violin morphing into a bell` (75 s, colour travelling 4754 → 402 Hz across the note), `sine > pwm > bell` (two nested morph positions via `asig_mid`, 63 s). **The architecture change BJ floated — two inferences with the morph done outside — is not needed for these.**
- **A triangle→sawtooth morph became reachable once the head prompt stated imode 4's fourth argument** (`6ca43ebe`). Measured on the local 12B, `a triangle morphing into a sawtooth`: it writes `aramp_a vco2 …, 4, kdw_a` and `aramp_b vco2 …, 4, kdw_b` — the morph on ONE generator by moving where the ramp breaks, which is what the identity in "Substrate" above makes possible — with the centroid travelling 2107.8 → 2149.9 → 2433.2 Hz. The same prompt had failed at 3 attempts before the correction.
- **A body's comment bulk plausibly costs compile attempts, and three prompts at temperature 0 cannot prove it.** Rewriting `analog_osc` took the entry from 77 to 86 lines and its longest run of hanging comment lines from 13 to 18, and the prompt that then failed had its failing line immediately below that block; trimming back to 71 lines and a run of 13 restored the compile count. But the count went 2/3 → 1/3 → 2/3 while **the identity of the failing prompt changed every time** — exactly the pattern already recorded for the `=`-before-opcode paragraph. Greedy decoding has no run-to-run variance, but any edit to the prompt material reshuffles every generation, so this is a reason to keep an entry's comments tight, not evidence that comments cause failures.

**The consultation, measured the day it landed (2026-07-24, `tools/lco_morph_corpus.txt`, same model, greedy, one process)**

| | compiled | mean attempts |
|---|---|---|
| word-matched `select()`, with the RENAMING paragraph | 7/8 | — |
| word-matched `select()`, without it | 7/8 | — |
| the author's own consultation, syntax gate only | 8/8 | 1.50 |
| **the consultation + the performance gate** | **8/8** | **1.12** |

- Every prompt in the set compiles AND renders, including `sine > pwm > bell`, which failed under both earlier states. Read this as "no regression, one prompt recovered", not as proof the consultation authors better: any prompt change reshuffles every greedy generation (see the corpus's own limit, above).
- **The author opened 10.5 of 98 entries on average** (6 to 16) when the library was 98, and the choices are visibly its own: `an elephant calling` → `bass_saw` + `sub_sine`; `accordeon > guitar` → `brass`, `cheby`, `clarinet`, `string` — it reached for the one reed in the library because there is no accordion entry, which is the same hole §6 item 3 records. Not re-measured against the 28-entry library.
- **A compiling orchestra was still silent.** `bright shimmer degrading to a dark rumble` passed at attempt 1 and rendered nothing: `vco2 …, 1`, where imode bit 1 means "skip initialisation". `csound --syntax-check-only` accepts it; the first k-cycle raises `vco2: not initialised`. `vco2 …, 2` without its `kpw` is the same class (`INIT ERROR`, note deleted). Both were reaching the engine as successful authorings. `perform_check()` closes it: the wrapped orchestra is played for `_PERF_SECS` (0.25 s, ~0.1 s of wall clock) through the real CLI with the voice channels preset to a played note (220 Hz, gate 1), and Csound's own runtime message goes back to the author as an ordinary repair. All 94 library snippets passed it on the day it landed; re-run 2026-07-29 over the 28-entry library, **92/92**. It tests whether the orchestra RUNS, never how it sounds — `asig = 0` passes.
- **The gate alone was not enough.** With it, the author reproduced the same `vco2 …, 1` byte for byte on the retry and the loop stopped: "not initialised" does not tell anyone that a `1` in the third position is the cause. `_mechanical_hint` now recognises that line too and names the one Csound fact the message omits (imode is a bit sum; bit 1 skips initialisation; the waveforms are 0/2/4). With the hint the same prompt repairs on the second attempt — and then authors it on the FIRST, with the colour travelling 1264 → 837 Hz across the note. It degrades.
- **The gate does not reach an installed T5ynth.** `perform_check` needs the csound CLI, because performing means `csoundStart` and doing that in-process would run model-written Csound inside the backend that holds the 12B model. `tools/bundle_csound_macos.sh` ships only `CsoundLib64`. Where there is no CLI the gate returns "unchecked", never a false failure — so the machine where "reports success, sounds silent" actually happens is the one machine the fix does not yet cover. Decide it with the Csound bundling (§6, release blocker).

## 6. Open items

Renumbered 2026-07-29. The old list had grown three duplicate numbering runs and a majority of its entries were about instruments that `defd42c9` deleted; those are gathered in one line at the end rather than left to be read as state.

### Ordered by BJ, newest first — not yet built

1. **„Crystal singing bowls in a cathedral" comes out extremely dissonant** (BJ, 2026-07-29): „Wäre gut da eine eigene Parametrisierung zu machen (oder Instrument)". Two facts about the ground it lands on: **`crystal` is not one of the 51 sound words**, and **`singing_bowl` was one of the 39 entries deleted on 2026-07-26** — so the author has neither a word nor a body to reach for and writes the bowl from nothing. Whether the answer is a new instrument or a parametrisation of an existing one is open, and either way it goes through `CLAUDE.md` → Instrument Authoring: a named method with a source first (a singing bowl is a modal body — `mode`, `barmodel`, or published bowl mode ratios), `nearest_existing.wav` from `struck_bar` or `cymbal` on disk *before* the new orchestra is written, and BJ's ear on the A/B.

2. **„Deep velvet echoes of shimmering golden chimes" has no velvet in it** (BJ, 2026-07-29, with the authored body). This one has a traceable cause, and it is not the author freelancing:

   - The velvet layer is **`velvety`'s shipped `code`, verbatim** up to renaming — `albd1 tone asig1, 220` · `asig1 = asig1 + albd1 * 0.25` · `asig1_f tone asig1, 2100`. The author did exactly what the lexicon told it to. **`velvety`'s code is two lowpass filters**, and its `why` says what it is: „a smooth+warm hybrid convention" — a convention, with no source and no measured correlate.
   - The same layer also carries **`glassy`'s clang code**, verbatim but for the ratio — `armc1 oscili 1, kfreq * 2.37` · `asig1 = asig1 * 0.725 + arng1 * 0.275`. A ring modulator at a non-integer ratio breeds inharmonic sidebands, so the body that is supposed to be velvet has a clang in it *and* a lowpass over the top.
   - **Hypothesis, not established:** the same misplaced inharmonic clang may be what makes item 1 dissonant. The body for that one has not been captured, so this is a thing to check, not a cause to report.

   This lands on the work BJ is doing in parallel today (`docs/LCO_TIMBRE_SEMANTICS.md`, commits `2ab9ded3` … `517fec57`), whose own finding is that **a sound word is never a filter** and that not one of the 51 words is an oscillator word. Treat that document as the live one; do not edit it or `src/gui/LcoTraceView.h`, `src/gui/PresetManagerPanel.h`, `tools/lco_audition_instrument.py` — all four are BJ's uncommitted working set.

3. **A reed-instrument entry.** BJ, 2026-07-24: „ja, mache einen eintrag für reed-instrumente". Wider open now than when it was written: `free_reed`, `harmonica`, `sax`, `double_reed`, `bagpipe` and `jaw_harp` all went in the revert, so **`clarinet` is the only reed in the library** and `organ` merely carries the words "reed organ". The nuance stands: the author writes a *good* accordion from its own knowledge (BJ: „das accordeon alleine ist überhaupt kein Problem → s. preset → klingt großartig"); what is missing is a curated, measured, ear-approved idiom. The consultation shows the hole from the inside — asked for `accordeon > guitar` it opens `brass`, `cheby`, `clarinet`, `string`. This build ships `wgclar` and `wgbrass`, which is where a reed entry starts.

4. **The performance gate does not reach an installed T5ynth, and that is solved WITH the Csound bundling** (BJ, 2026-07-24). `perform_check` needs a Csound in a separate process, because performing means `csoundStart` and doing that in-process would run model-written Csound inside the backend that holds the author model. The decided shape: a short-lived CHILD process of the backend (`sys.executable` plus a flag) that loads the already-bundled `CsoundLib64` through ctypes, plays the quarter second and exits with a return code — process isolation without shipping a CLI binary. Where there is no CLI the gate returns "unchecked", never a false failure, so the machine where "reports success, sounds silent" actually happens is the one machine the fix does not yet cover.

### `analog_osc` after the width rewrite — 2026-07-29

The rewrite itself is done, committed (`4610d216`, `6ca43ebe`, `b5968c94`) and approved by BJ on his own ear („funktioniert finde ich. commit"). One width position feeds both `vco2` generators, `wave` is the crossfade between them, and the movement source is the author's to write. What is left:

5. **What movement the entry owes now that the hardwired swing is gone.** The old body swept the duty at every setting, so every anchor moved whether or not anything asked it to; taking that out is what `feedback_no_builtin_vibrato` and `project_lco_position_not_depth` require, and the cost is visible: **81 % of the gate's axis-cube corners now stand still against 58 % before**, most of them at `age` = 0, which is the corner that asks for no drift at all. At the default the entry is clean — the 2026-07-29 audit reports no finding of any kind on it at 220 Hz — but the census reads it standing at **880 Hz (46.7 Hz travel, coherence 1.0) and 1760 Hz (29.2 Hz, 1.0)**. Coherent, and too small. The known cause is `age`: two of its three instabilities run at 0.043 and 0.057 Hz and are a static offset over a few seconds. The fix named on 2026-07-25 is a second, faster instability layer between roughly 0.5 and 15 Hz — not more depth. Deferred by BJ then; still deferred.

6. **`analog_osc` and `saw` used to render bit-identical at their defaults, and the fold-in settled it by removing `saw`.** The old finding was that an "analog oscillator" whose default is a plain sawtooth does not answer the word it was asked for. `56597664` deleted `saw` as an entry, so there is no longer a pair to be identical to — a prompt saying "sawtooth" now reaches `analog_osc` at `wave` 0 / `width` 0.02, which is the intended route. **The default itself was not changed**: `wave` 0.00, `width` 0.02, `drive` 0, `age` 0.35 is still a plain aged saw, and whether a prompt saying "minimoog" should land somewhere else is a sound decision, therefore BJ's. Note that `fat` no longer exists as an axis — BJ heard it as „Fat ist pwm, nicht fat" and it went out with the rewrite.

7. **`drive` does not scream, and the anchor no longer promises it will.** BJ, 2026-07-25: „drive hörbar als eine Art Verdichtung (aber nicht distortion), allerdings kein 'scream' in irgendeiner Form hörbar (soll das überhaupt?)". The `screaming` anchor is gone; the axis now runs `clean` / `warm` / `hot` and says what it does. His question — whether an oscillator is the right layer for a scream at all — is unanswered and is the sort of thing the filter belongs to the synth, not the oscillator.

8. **`rate` left the entry without a separate word from BJ.** The plan listed removing it as needing his say-so; what he gave was approval of the *sound* after the A/B. It had nothing left to set once the hardwired swing was gone, and the movement rate is now something the author writes (`klfo oscili 0.5, 0.5` — 0.5 cps, **two seconds a round trip**, which is the only rate figure left in the entry and the one an author copies).

9. **BJ's own end-to-end result is the one that counts, and it was measured on a different author model than the offline harness uses.** He ran „two detuned slow pwm square waves, 0%_100%" in the built synth: duty span **10.6 dB** — the architecture works, the author writes the source itself. Two things in that body are worth fixing at the layer that owns them, neither touched: `kpwm = 0.5 + 0.48 * klfo` with `klfo` at ±0.5 gives 26 %…74 %, not the 0 %…100 % asked for (it needs 0.98), and the second layer reads `kvol1`/`koct1` rather than `kvol2`/`koct2`, so the player's second mix and octave knobs are dead for that sound.

### Found by the 2026-07-29 audit over today's 28 entries

10. **`driven_metal`'s loudness follows the keyboard: 8.2 dB across 110–880 Hz (−2.72 dB/octave)**, against 0.0 dB of render-to-render scatter at 110 Hz. `drum_head` reads −2.99 dB/octave on the same measure. That is `M7`, the check that says the keyboard itself must not be a volume control.

11. **14 axes are declared in words and never shown as code** (`S4` + `M5`, "no `anchor_code`"). `string`'s `damp` and `pick` are two: the author is told what they do and never sees an exemplar, which is the one thing an anchor block exists for.

12. **`blown_bottle`'s `blow` moves loudness 1.21 dB over its travel**, against a 1.0 dB bound.

13. **`lco_axis_probe._MOVE_CENSUS` is stale and the tool says so out loud** — it carries 21 / 12 / 0 measured 2026-07-27; the library now reads **19 move at all six registers, 9 do not, 0 declare the event-texture class**. Update the constant and every comment quoting it. Note what the zero means: **no body in the library carries `; MOVEMENT: TEXTURE` any more** — every entry that did was deleted — so the one exemption that cannot be verified is currently unused.

14. **`string` fails movement on coherence, not on span** — 1613.9 Hz of colour motion at coherence 0.233. It is the last survivor of the class that used to include `drum_head`, `glass`, `struck_glass` and the rest of the noise-excited resonator banks, and the question BJ was asked and has not answered is still the right one: either such a body declares its liveness, or `moves()` needs a second branch for a body whose motion is dither. **Measured 2026-07-25 and still the strongest argument in it:** a smooth vibrato of a fifth passes at coherence 1.00 while an erratic wander of three quarters of an octave fails — `motion_coherence` measures SMOOTHNESS, not movement. Do not quiet it by adding declarations.

### The tools' own soft spots — each a plausible wrong number waiting

15. **The gate does not gate everything it reports.** Pitch is never a verdict; the defaults are exempt from most checks; the axis cube is 3 points; the register list is six A's; the decay exemption is inverted; the texture exemption is unverified by construction (§5); `--registers` is not forwarded; `--steps`/`--freq` can flip a verdict; axes inside block comments and dead axes both pass.

16. **The meter's soft spots**: `beat_cap_hz`, `partials` measured against the ask, `event_rate_hz` at the low end, `f0` on an inharmonic body, `motion_coherence`'s null at 32 Hz, `loudness_travel`'s null at 1/window. And the window-length trap in §4 — a reading taken in thirds cannot see anything above ~1 Hz.

17. **`lco_write` robustness, all reachable from a real reply:** the hyphen in a looked-up name, names found inside the code fence, `ß`, a single-variant `anchor_code` being dropped, and `--selftest` passing with the library file deleted.

18. **`tools/lco_recover_lost_keys.py` makes a false accusation** on a key it cannot find. (`lco_param_audit.py` had the same hole and it is fixed: it names the key, says why an entry is withheld, and exits 2.)

19. **Noise seeding.** The motion forms `wobble`, `evolve`, `flutter` and `shimmer` seed from `ivoice`, so sixteen voices are correlated differently than intended.

### The index, and what shortening it would cost

20. **DECIDED: keep the whole index, shorten it per entry, and functionality outranks economy.** BJ: „den index ökonomisch halten ABER FUNKTIONALITÄT muss Vorrang haben → hier nicht wild kürzen, hier immer testen an einer Reihe unterschiedlicher instrumente". No declared slot: a window that opens only once the author names a family restricts what it may see in order to orient itself, which is the standing rule.

    **The pressure is off for now** — the index was 113 019 characters at 131 entries and the library is 28, so re-measure before acting on any figure here. **The gate before any gloss is shortened** stands regardless, because shortening one is a capability change until measured otherwise: a frozen prompt corpus, fixed before the cut and not derivable from the shortened index, over the classes the library exists for (pwm, „a morphing into b", dirty/overdriven, moving) plus the families being cut. Measured before and after at three points: does the author still open the RIGHT entries; does the result still `perform_check`; does the objective signature hold (pwm → duty-cycle sideband asymmetry, morph → two distinct centroid plateaus, dirt → THD above the clean baseline). Any of the three regressing means the gloss stays long.

### Housekeeping and traceability

21. **~457 MB of untracked `tools/*_out/` render directories** (over 1 GB counting the ignored ones) and a set of untracked one-off scripts. Deleting anything under `tools/` is BJ's call. Note before deciding: `backend/dco_frames.py` is untracked but **is imported by the tracked test** `tools/test_dco_author.py`.

22. **`docs/plans/HANDOVER_lco_selfcorrect.md` is untracked** and describes the self-check/self-correction loop, which was deactivated 2026-07-21 (`dbd6c153`, `T5YNTH_LCO_SELFCHECK = 0`). It is history, not a plan.

23. **`string quartet` / `string ensemble` / `string section` reach both `strings` and `string`** — the bare word is inside the phrase and `_lookup` has no longest-wins rule. It no longer stands between the user and the library (`_lookup` reads the AUTHOR's reply), so at worst the author is handed one entry it did not ask for. Leave it: a longest-wins rule would start deciding which of two entries the author meant.

24. **A traceability gap, reported and not fixable without rewriting history.** The morph shape in `_SYSTEM_HEAD` — both ends in their own variables, `kmorph`, one crossfade — was swept into `b04c8ef4` ("fix(lco): the trace must not claim what nobody recorded"), whose message does not mention it. `git log -S'asiga   = <a' -- backend/lco_write.py` will find it.

### Closed by the revert — do not go looking for these

The following were open items on 2026-07-25 and are moot because their subject was deleted on 2026-07-26: the `ring`→`open` axis rename across seven entries; the `noise`/`pink_noise` de-duplication and the `withheld` mechanism's first users; the micro-fluctuation `character` axis built for `saw`/`square`/`pulse`/`triangle`/`sub_sine`/`bass_saw` and the 28-cent/0.69 Hz wobble that was waiting for BJ's ear; the metal family's ×1.0 mode and the `glass`/`struck_glass` split; `chiptune`'s `speed` axis; the `vibraphone`/`ring_mod` compensation fitted at four registers; the three axes whose bottom anchor equalled their default; the waterphone's un-parking; and the anchor census's 81-of-355 movement failures. Every one of them is readable at `25ff6d8b..51f108d2` if the entry is ever wanted back. **What is NOT moot is the method each of them established**, and that is why those passages stay in §4 and §5 rather than going with the entries.

## 7. What in `docs/LCO_CONCEPT.md` is now historical

The concept document is authoritative for **the goal (§1), the architecture (§2), what an instrument is (§3) and the platform invariants (§4)** — none of that has moved. Its account of the *implementation* predates the switch to the model-authored path (2026-07-22) and now points at code that does not exist:

| In the concept document | Actually, today |
|---|---|
| „Read this before touching … `backend/csound_orch.py`, or `backend/dco_llm_map.py`" | `backend/csound_orch.py` is deleted. The write path is `backend/lco_write.py`. |
| §2: „the prompt goes to a small model (currently `qwen2.5-7b-instruct`)" | The author is gemma-4-12B QAT 4-bit GGUF by default, an external API when one is configured, and it also does translation and re-prompt. |
| §2: „`build_orchestra()` in `backend/csound_orch.py` turns the reply into an orchestra" | The **model writes the orchestra body**. `lco_write.wrap()` only puts it in the host scaffold. The model no longer names keys for Python to assemble. |
| §5 title: „The three instruments (current proof of concept)" | 28 instruments, 11 of them parametrised. §5's *measured facts* about instruments 1–3 all still hold and are still the best record of them. |
| §8: the ten hand-maintained Python sets, `_ADJ_MAP` as post-mix DSP, `_emit_crossfade_morph` | All of that was `csound_orch.py`. The growth blocker it describes is gone with it; adding an instrument is now one lexicon entry plus a library rebuild. |
| §9 items 5, 6, 7 (cross-cutting properties into generation; the morph as a real waveform morph; the ten sets) | Answered by the architecture change: the model writes the code, so adjectives and morphs are in the emitted Csound by construction. §9 items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 stand. |

**§2 and §3 item 4 were CORRECTED in place on 2026-07-24** to describe the consultation — the index goes into the system prompt, the author names what it wants opened, Python fetches exactly that. Those two passages are BJ's order recorded, not a state report, and are authoritative; the rest of the table above still stands.

Also superseded by the same change: the plan file `/Users/joerissen/.claude/plans/hashed-chasing-snowflake.md` ("LCO v1: Adjektive in die Codegenerierung + 4 Familien parametrisieren") is written entirely against `backend/csound_orch.py`. Its *intent* — many adjectives must move parameters inside the algorithm — is now satisfied by the model writing the code. Its mechanics are not implementable.

**This needs BJ's decision:** fold these corrections into `LCO_CONCEPT.md` itself (it is his document and parts are dictated verbatim), or leave the concept document as the record of the design and let this file carry the current state.

---

## 8. Release blockers

These still make the LCO non-functional for anyone who is not on this machine.

1. ~~**CI ships no Csound.**~~ Settled: BJ chose vendoring (`brew install` is opaque and a rights problem; a Mac DMG serves one of three platforms). `third_party/csound/` carries the payload for macOS and Windows, no build machine needs Csound, and every CI build runs `tools/verify_csound_bundle.py` over every bundle. No entitlement is involved — measured: replacing a bundled library invalidates the bundle seal anyway, so the re-sign the NOTICE asks for is what settles library validation. See `docs/CSOUND_INTEGRATION.md`.
2. **There is no acquisition path for the author model.** The 12B GGUF is on the maintainer's disk; nothing in the SetupWizard fetches it. Without it there is no oscillator, by design — no model, no fallback, no tone. The external-API route (`_resolve_author_backend` → `backend/author_api.py`) is a second way in for a user who has a key, not a replacement for the acquisition path: it is opt-in, it needs a key the installer cannot supply, and a machine with neither is silent.
3. **The bundle carried no library at all until `df3b3cf5`, and that fix is unverified against a real PyInstaller run.** `lco_write.py` opens `lco_library.json` and `dco_lexicon.json` with a plain `open()` relative to its own `__file__`, which inside a frozen bundle is `_MEIPASS`; `pipe_inference.spec` did not list them, so the first LRO prompt in any installer raised `FileNotFoundError` while working perfectly from source. The spec now adds both and **raises at build time** if either is missing. Nobody has run PyInstaller since. Do that before the next tag.

---

## 9. Standing rules that govern work on the LRO

Not repeated here in full — they live in `CLAUDE.md` and in the session memory — but these decide most arguments:

- **No layer may constrain the author model deterministically.** Code CHECKS; it never decides. This is the rule that removed the word-matched `select()`, and it is also why a prose paragraph telling the author what to want is forbidden regardless of its statistics.
- **A "port X to Y" task is never a licence to rebuild X smaller** (`CLAUDE.md`, Migration & Substrate Discipline). The trigger is objective: it fires whenever a commit adds a fresh implementation of a capability an existing module already provides, or deletes a module the prompt path reached — regardless of what the task was called. The gate is a frozen corpus of the PRIOR system's capabilities, not the new implementation's green suite.
- **An instrument is chained to a named synthesis method with a source, written down before the first orchestra line** (`CLAUDE.md`, Instrument Authoring). `nearest_existing.wav` on disk first, one instrument at a time, fixed attempt budget, no self-scoring loop. BJ's ear decides; a self-built meter never does.
- **Test only in the built Standalone** for anything user-facing (since 2026-07-18). Offline measurement establishes facts; it does not establish that the feature works.
- **Nothing sound-shaping without an explicit order from BJ.** The oscillator is a spectrum source; the synth owns the envelope, and the filter belongs to the synth.
- **A body owns a POSITION, never the source that moves it.** There is no "depth" and no "attenuated" modulation — only an interval in the target's own unit (`project_lco_position_not_depth`, BJ 2026-07-29). A hardwired movement in a body takes the author's choice away and is the same offence as a prompt sentence telling it what to want.
