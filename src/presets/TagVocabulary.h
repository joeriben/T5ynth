/** Curated tag taxonomy surfaced in the Preset-Manager's "Known tags" cloud
 *  (Detail card + Save drawer) and used as the autocomplete vocabulary in
 *  the tag-input field.
 *
 *  Design notes:
 *   - Replaces the old `PresetTagSuggester` heuristic which silently injected
 *     useless tags ("hot", "dense", "sparse", …) derived from peak-level /
 *     RMS analysis. That heuristic was removed entirely in Phase 1.
 *   - Tags are SUGGESTIONS, not classifications. The user adds them by hand;
 *     nothing else writes tags.
 *   - The cloud renders `user-seen-tags ∪ canonical`, USER TAGS FIRST: the
 *     clouds clip after a few rows, so the tags actually in use in the
 *     library (= the sidebar's TAGS list) must render before the canonical
 *     starter pack or the two lists visibly disagree. The merge lives in
 *     PresetManagerPanel::applyTagVocabulary().
 *   - "generative" only appears when the generative sequencer is currently
 *     running, since that's the only context where the tag is meaningful
 *     (sequenced motion that varies between plays).
 *
 *  Vocabulary lives in this header (not a translation unit) because it is
 *  pure data — header-only avoids another compile target without
 *  introducing globals.
