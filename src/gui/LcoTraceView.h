// ── The LCO authoring trace ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// What replaced the "HEARD AS" text box in the LCO panel (BJ 2026-07-24): the
// authoring is shown as the sequence of things that actually happened, one
// station per step, instead of a reading with the raw Csound body printed under
// a rule.
//
//   HEARD      the prompt that was authored
//   OPENED     the library entries the AUTHOR asked to have opened, having read
//              the shelf and decided what this sound needs
//   WROTE      which model wrote it, and its own one-line reading
//   REPAIRED   the Csound errors it had to be repaired past (absent when it
//              compiled first try — an absent station is a fact, not a gap)
//   RUNNING    the compile state of the orchestra now in the engine
//
// Every station is a RECORD, never a reconstruction. The author is asked for no
// account of itself (its system prompt is untouched — BJ: "nur was ohnehin
// passiert ist"), so nothing here is the machine explaining itself; it is the
// write-path's own bookkeeping, which used to be discarded inside Python.
//
// Two consequences that are deliberate and must not be "tidied away":
//  - the chips are the AUTHOR's choice, and the caption says so. Python no
//    longer decides what the author may see: the system prompt carries the whole
//    shelf and the author names what it wants. `named` (the chips) and `opened`
//    (the count line) are kept apart because they differ exactly when the author
//    named no instrument — the backend then opens everything, and the station
//    must not read that back as "the author chose nothing".
//  - an empty motions list is shown as such. "No movement asked for" is exactly
//    the condition movement-by-default has to answer for, and hiding it would
//    hide the interesting case.
//
// Idle-cheap: paints only when something is set. No animation, and the only
// timer runs between a mouse-down and the flip it may become — never at idle.
//
// TWO SIDES (BJ 2026-07-24, step 2). The front is the trace above. The back is
// the Csound the author actually wrote, and ONLY that — not the host scaffold
// wrapped around it, which nobody wrote and nobody can change. Click and hold
// anywhere on the card turns it over, and again to come back.
