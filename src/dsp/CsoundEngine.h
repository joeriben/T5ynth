/**
 * Phase-1 Csound engine — one processor-owned Csound instance running 16
 * always-on, gate-sustained instruments (one per voice slot), driven purely
 * by named control channels the audio thread writes every sub-block.
 *
 * Phase 2 (SPEC_phase2_csound_swap.md) adds a swappable orchestra: prepare()
 * takes an optional orchestra-text override (nullptr = the Phase-1 built-in),
 * orchestraText() reports whichever text is currently compiled, and
 * primeForTakeover() silently settles a freshly-compiled instance's retrigger
 * state so a HELD note's later takeover doesn't audibly re-strike (S3). The
 * processor (PluginProcessor.h/.cpp) owns TWO of these and crossfades between
 * them; this class itself still only ever knows about ONE Csound instance.
 *
 * This header is compiled on EVERY platform/build and must never #include a
 * csound header (csound/sysdep.h leaks LIKELY, UNLIKELY, DIRSEP, the
 * ATOMIC_ family, and CS_PURE macro names that collide with identifiers
 * elsewhere in the codebase — the #undef hygiene block for that lives in
 * CsoundEngine.cpp,
 * copied from tools/csound_poc.cpp:94-102, confined to that one TU) nor any
 * JUCE header, so this class stays linkable from standalone offline test
 * binaries that don't pull in the plugin's JUCE tree.
 *
 * Real implementation (CsoundEngine.cpp) is only compiled when CMake found
 * CsoundLib64 (T5YNTH_HAS_CSOUND==1). Otherwise the inert stub below this
 * class (T5YNTH_HAS_CSOUND==0) makes every call a no-op / false / silence,
 * so call sites never need a CMake-level #ifdef — see SPEC §1/D5.

    // verbatim (a full CSD, following the Phase-1 channel/instrument contract — the
    // caller/assembler guarantees that, Phase 3; this method only cares that it
    // compiles and all 16x6 channels resolve). An explicit orchestraText always forces
    // a genuine (re)compile even at an unchanged sample rate — the D9 "already
    // prepared, just grow the buffers" fast path only ever applies when the text is
    // the SAME as whatever is currently compiled (see orchestraText() below), so an
    // orchestra-swap request can never be silently swallowed by that fast path.

     *
     *  Static and instance-free ON PURPOSE. It creates, uses and destroys its own
     *  CSOUND*, so it never touches the processor's two live engines and cannot
     *  disturb a sounding note. It also deliberately skips prepare()'s ~1.2 s
     *  warmup: that warmup exists so a freshly compiled engine can take over a
     *  HELD note without a click, which has no meaning for a render nobody hears.
     *
     *  THREADING: call from a background thread. It cannot reach the processor's
     *  csoundLifecycleMutex_ (static, owns no engine), so instead it takes the
     *  process-wide lock every prepare() also takes, which keeps the
     *  create/compile/start/destroy sequence serialised across ALL instances —
     *  the invariant the processor already maintains for its two engines, rather
     *  than an exemption from it.
     *
     *  IT DOES NOT WAIT FOR A CONCURRENT ORCHESTRA SWAP — the swap waits for IT.
     *  Called right after a bake, this thread reaches create/compile before the
     *  message thread has run the swap's own prepare(), and wins the lock. The
     *  render loop releases it (only create/compile/start/destroy are held, ~50-165
     *  ms measured), but for that window a live swap stalls, so the new sound is
     *  audible that much later. Do not call this on a path where that delay is not
     *  acceptable.
     *
     *  Voice 1 only (channel 0 of the 16-channel bus). Gate opens at t=0 with a
     *  single trigger and closes at `gateOffSeconds`, so a self-decaying key gets
     *  its tail inside the window and a standing tone gets a clean release.
     *
     *  Peak-normalised to -12 dBFS, because an absolute level would confound a
     *  learned ear that is level-sensitive. A render whose peak never leaves the
     *  noise floor is returned EMPTY rather than amplified: "the oscillator made
     *  no sound" is a finding, and normalising silence would hide it behind
     *  amplified numerical dust.
     *
     *  @return interleaved-free mono samples at `sampleRate`; EMPTY on a compile
     *          error, a contract violation (ksmps/nchnls/MYFLT), a silent render,
     *          or in a build without Csound. Never throws.
     *
     *  DEPRECATED (LCO self-check deactivated, BJ 2026-07-21): this offline probe
     *  existed only to feed the self-listen / compare loop, which is switched OFF
     *  (PromptPanel.cpp T5YNTH_LCO_SELFCHECK = 0). No live caller remains.
