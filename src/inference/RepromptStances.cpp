    //     the backend's no_repeat_ngram_size spanned the prompt, so spelling the
    //     form out here made it unemittable. Those transforms are gone (measured
    //     2026-07-22: they were the small model's crutch), so the form stands on
    //     its own now.
    // (2) THE FIRING CRITERION is the DOMINANT CHARACTER, not a word count. The
    //     earlier draft fired "ONLY when MOST of the description names the
    //     opposite AND little or nothing in it matches". That AND can never hold
    //     for a named instrument: a wrong render still measures some generic word
    //     — warm / full-bodied / tonal — that fits, so "little or nothing
    //     matches" is always false and the verdict was structurally always
    //     "matches" (reported 2026-07-21: a "wurlitzer" built as metallic_fm and
    //     a "detuned rhodes" built as a saw>pulse morph both passed). Recalibrated

    //     mismatches → 1, still 0 false accusations (the velvety "shattering
    //     glass" and correctly-rendered electric pianos all still pass).
    //     KNOWN RESIDUAL LIMIT: a wrong render whose machine-listening words are
    //     genuinely instrument-compatible (a warm, full-bodied metallic_fm heard
    //     as "wurlitzer") is NOT catchable from the description alone — the
    //     category error does not surface in CLAP's coarse words, and feeding the
    //     author's chosen method into the comparer was measured not to move this
    //     model. That case needs a sonic reference, not a better prompt.
    // (3) THE DESCRIPTION IS A SET. One stray tag among agreeing ones is the ear's
    //     noise (clangy/steely/buzzing ARE shattering glass; a lone "velvety" is
    //     not a miss).
    // (4) CONTRADICTION, not absence. A quality the description does not mention
    //     says nothing: the listener does not name everything it hears.
    // (5) "Close qualities agree" sets the bias to SILENCE ON DOUBT — a false flag
    //     teaches the user to ignore the section; a missed flag still leaves the
    //     full description on screen.
    // (6) It may NOT propose a better prompt (unauthorized sound-shaping).
