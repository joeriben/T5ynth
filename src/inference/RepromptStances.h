/**
 * Stance / coupling logic for the CLAP→LLM semantic self-listening loop.
 *
 * A faithful C++ port of the curated subset of tools/clap_llm_loop.py (the
 * verified, working algorithm). This module is the interpreter HALF of the loop
 * on the plugin side: it provides the per-stance system prompts, the per-stance
 * user-turn builders, the leak/overrun cleaner, and the concat coupling helper.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose — it depends only on juce_core (juce::String /
 * juce::StringArray), NOT on PipeInference and NOT on any audio/DSP code. That
 * keeps the backend `interpret` op generic (the stance lives here, not in the
 * subprocess) and makes this logic unit-testable in isolation.
 *
 * Stance keys mirror BlockParams.h RepromptStance::kEntries[i].key, which in turn
 * mirror the keys of clap_llm_loop.py's MODES dict. The SIX shipped stances are:
 *   transcribe, entkitscher, verniedlicher, variation, abduction, opposite.
 * (planetarizer/develop/critique from the tool are intentionally NOT ported —
 * too complex for the local Qwen2.5-1.5B interpreter; see clap_llm_loop notes.)
 *
 * ONE stance is NOT a port and has no Python mirror: "selfcheck" (below). It
 * JUDGES a sound instead of generating the next prompt, so it is absent from both
 * clap_llm_loop.py MODES and BlockParams kEntries, and the "VERBATIM from
 * clap_llm_loop.py" contract above does not cover it — its wording was derived
 * from measurements taken in this repo, and its tests assert against itself.
