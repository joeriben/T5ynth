# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build_clean -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build_clean --config Release -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

Always `build_clean/` with Release config. Artifacts at `build_clean/T5ynth_artefacts/Release/{Standalone,VST3,AU}/`.

For dev: the Python backend runs from `backend/pipe_inference.py` via the local `.venv` — no PyInstaller needed during iteration. PyInstaller is only for release builds.

## Architecture

Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full code-level walkthrough. Key facts:

- **Two-process design:** JUCE C++ plugin + Python inference subprocess communicating over stdin/stdout binary protocol (`docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md`).
- **PluginProcessor** owns everything: APVTS (single source of truth for all real-time params), DSP chain, VoiceManager (16-voice pool), PipeInference client, sequencers.
- **PluginEditor** is a thin wrapper — all UI lives in `src/gui/MainPanel` and its child panels.
- **processBlock** reads all APVTS params into a `BlockParams` struct once per block. Voice rendering never touches APVTS directly.
- **Inference is blocking** — `PipeInference::generate()` runs on a background thread in PromptPanel, never on the audio thread.
- **Engine data distribution:** Master oscillator/sampler instances on the processor, per-voice copies share buffer data via pointers. Lock-free by design.

## JUCE Safety (BLOCKING — check before every build)

1. Every `juce::Timer` subclass MUST call `stopTimer()` in its destructor, BEFORE any member is destroyed.
2. NEVER call `setLookAndFeel(nullptr)` — crashes macOS WindowServer, killing ALL GUI apps.
3. APVTS attachments (`unique_ptr<SliderAttachment>`) must be declared AFTER their target components in the `.h` file (reverse destruction order).
4. NEVER allocate memory, lock a mutex, or do file I/O on the audio thread.
5. After copying files into an app bundle, re-sign: `codesign --force --deep --sign -`.

## Performance (BLOCKING — read `docs/PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md` before adding GUI/DSP code)

Idle CPU regressions are the #1 historical class of bug in this project. Before adding a timer callback, a `setColour()`, a `repaint()`, an APVTS lookup in `processBlock`, or any per-sample work: consult the anti-pattern catalogue and the audioIdle gate in `docs/PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md`. Profile with `sample(1)` (methodology in §4 of the guide) when in doubt.

## Key Constraints

- The Python backend exists because Stable Audio requires `torchsde`'s BrownianTree SDE sampler — no C++ equivalent exists. Do not attempt C++ inference.
- PyInstaller runtime hook (`backend/runtime_hook.py`) disables `multiprocessing.resource_tracker` to prevent fork bombs on macOS. Never add multiprocessing-using packages to runtime hooks.
- `JUCE_WEB_BROWSER=1` is required (Manual overlay). Linux needs explicit `juce::pkgconfig_JUCE_BROWSER_LINUX_DEPS` link + `libgtk-3-dev`.

## Process

- Read ALL relevant files before writing code. State reasoning before acting.
- After every change to BEHAVIOUR: spawn a verification agent (model: opus) with "This code has a bug. Find it." Behaviour means control flow, state, DSP, threading, IPC, lifetime — anything where the code can be wrong about something. A change that only edits user-facing strings, comments or docs has no hypothesis to falsify: read it and ship it. Never spawn an agent to review wording.
- Before every build: check JUCE destruction order, audio thread safety, crash vectors.
- One concern per commit.
- Never hallucinate names — grep the repo. Canonical: "UCDCAE AI Lab".
- Never modify preset files (.t5p) or binary resources without explicit permission.
- Never add UI elements not requested.

## Platform Invariants (BLOCKING — never trade away for an unrelated task)

These are user-observable fundamentals — the instrument's flow concept, not soft preferences. Changing one is NEVER an acceptable side effect of a "stabilize" / perf / refactor / bugfix task. If a task appears to REQUIRE weakening an invariant (e.g. a race or crash seems to force it), STOP and surface the conflict — do the harder correct fix, or ask. Do not pick the convenient shortcut; a diff that locally "stabilizes" something can silently abolish a fundamental and still pass review.

- **A HELD note always plays the CURRENT sample, crossfading over the Regen XFade time.** With A/B drift active, regenerating while a note is held MUST switch the held voice to the new sample via an equal-power crossfade over the global Drift Crossfade (`driftCrossfade`, "Regen XFade", default 200 ms) — NOT a hard swap, and NOT a fixed declicker that ignores the control. All three engines crossfade-follow over that time: Wavetable (`morphToFramesFrom`), Freeze (`morphToBufferFrom`), Sampler (`morphToBufferFrom`). Do NOT re-freeze held voices onto the old buffer, and do NOT swap-then-mask the seam. Broken twice: d03c607a froze held sampler voices (restored f872c73c); a follow-up then hard-swapped + declicked, ignoring Regen XFade (fixed 86726496). Guard: `tools/audition_sampler_follow.cpp` (asserts click-free AND actually-transitioning on both render paths). RT-safe pattern on the lock-free macOS audio thread = an existing engine's morph (atomic master-snapshot read + reclaim slot, `std::atomic_load/store/exchange_explicit`); the sampler morph is audio-thread-sited with plain per-voice morph state + a single reclaim slot, like Wavetable. Mirror an existing engine — never invent a one-off.

When a commit touches a guardian path (voice/buffer distribution, engine data flow, modulation routing), call out any behavior change in the commit body and verify the relevant invariant still holds (audition + adversarial review).

## The T5 Oscillator's Existence Purpose (BLOCKING — never argue against it, never "repair" it)

BJ, 2026-07-29, after an assistant inverted it inside a single answer: **"Der komplette Punkt dieses T5-Oszillators ist es, in Bereiche zu kommen, die nicht trainiert wurden und nicht gesehen wurden und nicht gelernt wurden."**

The prompt/embedding path exists to produce **conditioning that no text can produce**. The A↔B slider (range ±2, so most of its travel is extrapolation *past* both prompts), `_echo_through_null` (2·null − A is an anti-prompt, textually unreachable by construction), `magnitude` (to 5.0), `noise_sigma`, `dimension_offsets`, `semantic_axes` — all of it is one programme. Out-of-distribution is the product, not the risk.

**The inversion this forbids** — it happened, and it reads as diligence: calling a construction "off-manifold", "out-of-distribution", "a chimera", "the encoder never saw two stitched sequences", "not what the model expects" — treating THAT as the defect, and then offering a well-behaved, in-distribution construction (concatenated prompts, one text field, a grammatical sentence, a tamer injection mode) as the FIX. Every one of those phrases describes the target. On this path, each is a category error, not a finding.

**Objective tripwire, because the prose above depends on self-recognition and self-recognition is exactly what failed.** The direction of a change here is measurable, so measure it instead of judging it — `tools/measure_conditioning_drive.py`, both engines, CPU, under a minute:

- **Drive** = ‖proj(cond)‖ over the real tokens. CFG's unconditional branch is *literally* zero context (`null_embed = torch.zeros_like(cross_attn_cond)`, dit.py:445/518) and `to_cond_embed` is bias-free, so this norm IS the distance from "unconditioned". Falling drive = falling toward the model's prior = toward the most-trained, most-average region it owns. **That** is the regression direction — not unfamiliarity.
- **Direction** = cos to each pole prompt, same projected tensor.
- Before proposing any change on this path, state both numbers. A change that lowers drive without changing direction is a loss whatever else it fixes. A change that alters direction while holding drive is the instrument working. (Measured example: the shipped `linear` midpoint sits at 0.69–0.73 of pole drive; norm-preserved it reaches 0.83–0.92 with cos to both poles unchanged to ±0.002.)
- The only real boundary is **collapse**, not unfamiliarity: the point where the DiT stops producing structure at all — documented and paid for once (zeroing SA3's learned padding → ~10.76 Hz buzz). "The model has not seen this" is never that boundary.

**Tame constructions may be ADDED, never substituted.** Concatenated A+B token blocks, score-level composition (Composable Diffusion), in-distribution phrasing are legitimate as their own clearly-labelled injection modes next to `linear` / `delta` / `late_step` / `layer_split` / `kombi*`. Proposing one as the *repair* of an unseen construction is the inversion above. Linear stays the centre (see the A/B-equality design); the others extend it.

## Migration & Substrate Discipline (BLOCKING — a "port X to Y" task is never a licence to rebuild X smaller)

Born from a real, expensive regression (2026-07-17): told to move the existing rich DCO/LCO **lexicon** (which already knew pwm, morph chains, dirty/overdriven, moving/evolving, inharmonic partials) onto a live **Csound** oscillator, the implementation instead **deleted the lexicon and built a from-scratch 12-word static-partial replacement**. Result: "pwm square wave" rendered as "bright square_stack 8' +vibrato" (a static Fourier square + a fake pitch vibrato — not PWM at all); dirty/overdriven/moving/morphing all silently gone. Two days of ear-testing missed it because every test prompt was a *static* timbre. The order was "switch it to Csound", not "destroy it".

Three hard rules, each independently BLOCKING:

1. **Migration preserves capability; it never reimplements a subset.** When told to port / switch / move / rebuild an existing capable system X onto a new substrate Y, the deliverable is *X's capabilities expressed on Y* — never a greenfield reimplementation that quietly drops what X could do. BEFORE writing Y: enumerate X's existing features/vocabulary in writing (grep the old code — the lexicon keys, the connectors, the techniques), and for EACH one either prove it survives on Y or surface the specific ones that can't and stop. Deleting X's implementation is the LAST step, only after parity is demonstrated — never the first. Reducing a rich system to a convenient subset is a destruction, not a migration, even when every commit builds green.

2. **A substrate chosen because it already knows the domain must be USED for that knowledge.** Csound was chosen precisely because it natively does pwm (`vco2`+`kpw`), FM (`foscil`), waveshaping/dirt, and k-rate motion/morph. If you find yourself hand-authoring a lookup table that reinvents a crippled subset of what the substrate already provides (e.g. static additive partial tables in place of Csound's live oscillators), **STOP** — you are throwing away the entire reason the substrate was chosen. The LLM-routes-to-prefabricated-code guardrail means the prefabricated code must be REAL, capability-complete substrate idioms, not a toy vocabulary.

3. **Acceptance-test the CLASS the feature exists for, not the cases the implementation finds easy.** If the system's whole point is moving / evolving / dirty / morphing sounds, the test corpus MUST contain moving/evolving/dirty/morphing prompts, and an objective check that they actually move/evolve/dirty/morph (e.g. spectral centroid travels, THD rises). A corpus of only the easy (static) cases shares the implementation's blind spot and certifies nothing — a green suite over the wrong class is worse than no suite, because it reads as proof. Movement-by-default is a documented platform fundamental ([[project_lco_movement_by_default]]); a fundamental that is a requirement but not a test is a regression waiting to ship.

**Objective tripwires — because rules 1–3 as prose depend on self-recognition and by-ear honesty, which is exactly what failed here (an adversarial pass against these very rules surfaced each hole below):**

- **The trigger is objective, not a self-diagnosis.** This discipline fires whenever a commit ADDS a fresh implementation of a capability an existing module already provides, OR DELETES/replaces a module a prompt or LLM-routing path reached — regardless of whether the task was framed as migration, feature, refactor, or "delete dead code." The originating regression shipped as `feat(csound)` + `chore(csound): delete the dead … cluster`, never as a migration; a rule that waits for you to *call* it a migration cannot catch a failure whose essence is misrecognition. About to delete a `backend/` file the prompt pipeline imported? This section is active.
- **Parity = the PRIOR system's own capability corpus passing on Y — never the new implementation's green suite.** A corpus synthesized from the new vocabulary inherits its blind spot by construction (the reverted `csound_lexicon_fidelity.py` tested only the four LFO motions the implementation itself defined, and passed). Before deleting X, grep X's real capability prompts (pwm, "a morphing into b", dirty/overdriven, moving) into a frozen corpus that CANNOT be regenerated from Y; assert each capability's objective signature (pwm → duty-cycle sideband asymmetry; morph → ≥2 distinct spectral-centroid plateaus across the note; dirt → THD above the clean baseline). "My new tests are green" is not parity; by-ear "sounds fine" is not proof. The reason this is a rule and not a preference: **a corpus the system under test could have absorbed measures its memory, not its capability.** Siedenburg & Saitis (2023, arXiv:2304.07830) rest their entire comparison on the human dataset postdating their model's training material — without that, a match would have proved nothing about the model and everything about what it had read.
- **Two mechanical gates that fire at authoring time, either of which would have caught this on day one:** (a) the frozen old-corpus parity test above, gating deletion of the old modules; (b) a substrate-idiom grep — if the substrate was chosen for `vco2`/`kpw`/`foscil` and the emitted orchestra contains none of them (only `oscili`/`lfo`), fail. An additive `oscili` bank is precisely the toy vocabulary rule 2 forbids.
- **Name the layer that owns movement.** If the oscillator is deliberately a standing tone while [[project_lco_movement_by_default]] still requires the sound to MOVE, the morph/motion capability must be proven at the layer that DOES own it, on the same end-to-end prompt path the user drives. A per-layer "not my job" must never leave a required capability untested at every layer — resolve the standing-tone-vs-movement split in writing before shipping.

## Instrument Authoring (BLOCKING — every lexicon/library entry, every Csound body)

Born from a real, expensive regression (2026-07-25/26): one session added 30+ lexicon instruments in ~24 h, "optimised" them against a meter it had built itself, never heard one against a real reference, and all 39 entries had to be reverted (`defd42c9`). None was convincing. The cost was days of work and a token spend that would have been four figures in euros.

Five rules, each independently BLOCKING. They apply to any commit that adds or edits an instrument body in `backend/lco_library.json` / `backend/dco_lexicon.json`, or any Csound body anywhere.

1. **Chained to existing synthesis methods.** Before the first line of orchestra, the method and its source are written down: modal synthesis with *published* mode ratios; Karplus-Strong / Jaffe-Smith; an FM algorithm from the literature; a documented Csound idiom (`vco2`+`kpw`, `foscil`) or a shipped model opcode (`fmrhode`, `fmwurlie`, `fmbell`, `fmb3`, `fmvoice`, `fmpercfl`, `fmmetal` — all present in the project's Csound). **Cannot name the method AND a source → the instrument is not built.** No invented instrument mechanics, no "modelled to the best of my knowledge". This is stricter than `docs/LCO_CODE_PROVENANCE.md`, which secures the *licence*; this secures that the *method itself exists*.

2. **Use the substrate's model as the substrate wrote it.** Two things are forbidden on top of someone else's model: a fitted curve, polynomial or measured constant laid over its *output* to flatten a behaviour you did not like, and silently defaulting away the behaviour the model is characteristic for (tremolo at `0.01` = a body that does not wobble). One control must also not drive two distinct model inputs — that is a knob whose meaning cannot be stated.

   When a model has a known error, there are exactly two honest routes: **derive** the correction from the model's own source and name that source, or **declare the error as a property** of the entry and choose a range where it does not matter. Measuring the error and hardcoding the number is neither. Note the boundary: this is about the model's *output*. Computing the *input* a model needs — a corrected note frequency, an excitation amplitude the source documents — is ordinary engineering and is not what this forbids.

3. **The acceptance criterion is never self-scored.** An entry is done when BJ has heard it A/B **against the closest thing the lexicon already has**, on disk. Deliverable per instrument: one folder with `nearest_existing.wav` and `new.wav`, same pitch, length and loudness. Own measurements may accompany the result; they never decide it. A green suite built from the implementation's own vocabulary certifies nothing.

   **And repeating a self-assessment does not convert it into evidence.** N runs of my own judgement are one judgement, N times. High agreement between runs is a property of the thing generating them, not of the sound: Siedenburg & Saitis (2023, arXiv:2304.07830) had fifty independent conversations of one model rate the same instruments, and on `brassy, metallic` those fifty agreed with each other at r = 0.72 where 540 human listeners agreed at ≈ 0 — while the same model's overall timbre space matched the human one at r = −.07, i.e. chance. So an ensemble, a majority vote, a second and third pass, a bigger sample of my own ratings: none of it reaches the gate above. Only BJ's ear does.

   **The comparison target follows the claim the entry makes.** Default is the existing lexicon, because **this is a synth** (BJ, 2026-07-26 — see the answered question at the end of this section): what the A/B has to establish is the thing BJ demanded of every new element after the revert, that it is distinctive, controllable, playable material earning its place against improving what already exists. BUT an entry that takes a real instrument's NAME claims that instrument, and is compared against a recording of it — real WAV or SA3-generated, per `feedback_compare_against_real_reference`. That is what the reverted `vibraphone` and `waterphone` failed, and "it is a synth" does not retire it; it only means most bodies should not be borrowing those names in the first place. Either way the anchor is external and fixed — a shipped entry or a recording, never the author's opinion — which is what keeps this a gate and not an appeal.

   Two objective declarations belong in the entry, because "it is material" does not excuse not knowing what the material does: whether the body **follows `kfreq`** (several models here do not — `wgbrass` ignores it, `wgbowedbar` locks onto a fixed mode away from a narrow bow-position window), and whether it **stands or decays**. A mode-locked or fixed-pitch body is legitimate material, but it must be declared as such so the author never routes it as a melodic voice, and combines it with a pitched layer via `+` when the note needs a pitch at all.

4. **Comparison first, code second.** The `nearest_existing.wav` must be rendered and on disk before an orchestra line of the new entry is written, and the entry it comes from named. This is the order reversal that turns rule 3 from an appeal into a gate: pick the incumbent while you still might lose to it.

5. **No quantity targets, no unattended optimisation.** The unit of work is ONE instrument. "Add N instruments" is an unbounded order and was half the cause. Fixed attempt budget agreed up front; when it is spent the entry is dropped rather than optimised further (`feedback_quality_bar_omit_mediocre`). No batches, no agent fleets for lexicon entries, no self-scoring loop left running.

6. **Enter through the physical model, not the FM toy.** Convincing virtual instruments built on Csound exist; the bar is reachable and "no Csound library can sound good" is a false excuse (BJ, 2026-07-26). This build (Csound 6.18) ships the real models: waveguides `wgbow`, `wgflute`, `wgclar`, `wgbrass`, `wgpluck`, `wgpluck2`, `wgbowedbar`; Bilbao's finite-difference `barmodel`, `platerev`, `prepiano`; the modal filter bank `mode`; strings `streson`, `repluck`, `pluck`; Cook's modal bars `marimba`, `vibes`, `gogobel` and waveguide `mandol`; the mass-spring network `scanu`/`scanu2`/`scans`; and the PhISEM particle models `shaker`, `guiro`, `cabasa`, `sekere`, `stix`, `crunch`, `sandpaper`, `dripwater`, `tambourine`, `sleighbells`, `bamboo`. Since 2026-08-06 it also ships **the 27 STK opcodes** (`STKBowed`, `STKBlowBotl`, `STKBlowHole`, `STKSaxofony`, `STKBandedWG`, `STKModalBar`, `STKMandolin`, `STKStifKarp`, `STKShakers`, `STKVoicForm` …). They were long recorded here as "a separate plugin and simply missing"; that was wrong. `libstkops` was in the payload the whole time and was refusing to register, because Csound's STK module reads `getenv("RAWWAVE_PATH")` for STK's data files and declines entirely when it is unset — measured, 2267 opcode entries against 2294. The data now ships beside the library as `Contents/libs/rawwaves/` and both `CsoundEngine.cpp` and `lco_write.py` point the variable at it (`docs/CSOUND_INTEGRATION.md`). **Three properties before building on them, all measured 2026-08-06:** frequency is an **i-rate** argument, so an STK body does NOT follow `kfreq` and the `; FOLLOWS kfreq: no` declaration of rule 3 applies to every one of them; a rawwave file STK asks for and does not find is neither a compile error nor silence but an uncaught `stk::StkError` that `abort()`s the process, which inside a plugin is the host DAW; and Csound's Windows release ships no `stkops` module at all, so an entry written on one plays on macOS and not on Windows — say so in the entry. One absence remains, **measured on this machine, 2026-07-26**, not assumed: **Faust is a trap — do not reach for it.** `faustgen`/`faustcompile` appear in `csound -z1` and `libfaustcsound.dylib` loads, but `faustcompile {{ process = _ ; }}` returns -1 with no diagnostic, and an `import("stdfaust.lib")` **segfaults the host process** — inside the plugin that kills the synth. So `physmodels.lib` is NOT reachable here. Verify any opcode with `csound -z1` before reaching for it, and for anything that compiles at runtime, verify it actually compiles — a registered name is not a working opcode. The `fm*` family (`fmrhode`, `fmbell`, …) is present but is the toy tier: reaching for it when a physical model covers the body is the same failure the Migration & Substrate Discipline section describes. FM itself stays — the hard-won metals and glass come from it and there has been an FM renaissance (Digitone, opsix, Operator), BJ 2026-07-26 — but the FM *electric piano* specifically is 1990s technology this project can do without (same day), so do not spend a build on one.

**Answered, 2026-07-26 — the question that gated all of the above.** Asked whether the LRO is meant to imitate real instruments or to translate language into *sound spaces*, BJ: *"material → das ist ein synth!"* — said of two measured bodies that stand and are distinctive but do NOT play the note you press (`wgbowedbar` locked on a fixed mode; `repluck` under broadband excitation, 387 Hz for a played 440, several hundred partials). So the target is **material, not imitation**, and `project_lco_imagination_is_the_goal` is the operative goal.

What this does NOT relax — the revert of 39 entries was caused by invention and by self-scoring, and "it is a synth" is not a licence to return to either:

- Rule 1 stands undiminished, and matters more, not less: a named synthesis method with a source, written down before the first orchestra line. Freedom about the *result* is not freedom about the *mechanism*.
- Rule 2 stands: use the substrate's model, never bend it straight with your own fitted numbers.
- Rule 5 stands: one instrument at a time, fixed attempt budget, nothing left optimising unattended.
- BJ's ear still decides, never a self-built meter. What changed is only what the A/B is against.

## Release (BLOCKING — applies to every `v*` tag)

Before `git push origin v*` runs, EVERY step of `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §7 must have been executed AND the evidence pasted into the conversation. No exceptions, no "I already know it works".

In addition to §7 as written:

- **Per-model smoke-test.** For every model added or whose loading path changed in the commit range since the previous tag: run `backend/pipe_inference.py` end-to-end against the actual model files the user will download, confirm a successful generation. The default-preset check in §7 step 3 does NOT cover new models.
- **Dependency pin audit.** If `backend/requirements.txt` changed, OR if a new model was added that requires a specific `stable-audio-tools` / `diffusers` / `transformers` feature: verify the pin (or absence of pin) in `requirements.txt` resolves to a version that supports the model. `pip index versions <pkg>` + reading the model config's expected kwargs is the minimum check.
- **Never force-push to a release tag** unless §11 Option A applies (no published release exists). Always prefer a new patch tag.

Diagnostic discipline when a release crashes in user hands:

- Read primary sources before hypothesizing. `gh run view <id> --log | grep <package>` is the first command, not the last.
- Do not present unverified hypotheses as causes. If you have not reproduced the bug or located the failure in source, say "hypothesis, unverified".
