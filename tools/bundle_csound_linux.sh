# distribution's own build, with only its recorded search path rewritten so it
# resolves inside the artefact instead of in /usr/lib.
#
# The plugin modules land in libs/Opcodes64 — the same sibling-of-the-library
# layout macOS uses, which is what src/dsp/CsoundEngine.cpp looks for. A machine
# without a bundled copy (the .deb, which depends on libcsound64-6.0 instead) has
# no such sibling directory, so Csound's own resolution is left alone there.
#
# The linked binary keeps its SONAME reference either way, so ONE build serves
# both: an rpath that resolves to nothing falls through to the default search.

# The check that matters: the CSOUND payload must resolve inside the artefact. A
# single survivor means the LRO is silent on a machine without Csound, which is the
# whole case this exists for.
#
# The scope is per file, and the difference is not cosmetic. For the files this
# script copied, "outside the artefact" is always a failure: copy_with_deps pulled
# in every non-system dependency recursively, so anything still pointing at /usr/lib
# is a copy that did not happen or an rpath that did not take. The BINARY is not one
# of those files — it is the application, and it legitimately links the
# distribution's ALSA, fontconfig, freetype and curl, none of which this script
# bundles or should bundle. Holding it to the payload's rule failed the build on
# every one of those (measured on CI 2026-07-30: 36 flagged, not one of them
# Csound's). What it owes is narrower and is asserted positively below: the Csound
# library, and anything else the payload put in libs/, must come from libs/.
