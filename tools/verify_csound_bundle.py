"""Does a built bundle carry a WORKING Csound of its own?

The whole point of bundling Csound is the machine that does NOT have Csound
installed, and on the machine that does, a broken bundle is indistinguishable
from a good one: the loader silently falls through to the system copy, the
library loads, the orchestra compiles, the sound plays. A green run here would
then certify nothing — which is exactly the trap this file exists to avoid.

    macOS    tools/verify_csound_bundle.py build_clean/T5ynth_artefacts/Release/Standalone/akroasys.app
    Windows  tools/verify_csound_bundle.py build\\T5ynth_artefacts\\Release\\Standalone
    Linux    tools/verify_csound_bundle.py build/T5ynth_artefacts/Release/Standalone

Every platform ends in the same place: load the SHIPPED library, prove the plugin
opcode modules came with it, then compile and PLAY a real LRO orchestra in the
host's own scaffold (backend/lco_write.wrap) and require non-silent samples.
They differ in how the fall-through is ruled out, because the loaders differ:

  macOS    the runtime half runs under `sandbox-exec` with every Homebrew Csound
           path denied, and FIRST proves the denial actually bites.
  Windows  there is no sandbox, and none is needed for the question at hand: the
           DLL is loaded by absolute path, `GetModuleFileNameW` is read back to
           prove the loaded module IS the shipped file, and the opcode directory is
           set explicitly. The payload's own dependencies are the OS plus the MSVC
           runtime (`VCRUNTIME140`, `MSVCP140`, the UCRT) — measured from the PE
           headers, and the same runtime our own MSVC build already requires, so
           this run does not certify anything about a machine without it.
  Linux    the build machine HAS Csound installed (that is where the bundle comes
           from), so the same trap applies as on macOS and there is no sandbox-exec
           to answer it with. Instead the bundled library is loaded by absolute path
           and /proc/self/maps is read back to prove the mapping is the bundled file
           and not /usr/lib — which is the exact statement, not an approximation of
           it. The static half reads every bundled ELF's rpath and resolved
           dependencies and refuses anything outside the artefact.

What it does not do: launch the Standalone. That test is BJ's fourth requirement
and needs a person or a driven GUI; this file is the part that can run on every
build, and it covers everything between the shipped bytes and audible samples.
