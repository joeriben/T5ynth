"""Measure an LCO body — with a meter calibrated on signals whose answer is known.

Every number this file reports about a curated instrument was, at some point in
this project, first reported WRONG by a plausible-looking measurement:

  - an FFT-peak `f0` on a noise-excited comb measures the loudest PARTIAL, not
    the fundamental, and reports a confident, wrong pitch;
  - an autocorrelation `f0` octave-errs on a sparse harmonic series (`pluck` came
    back at -1200 and -2789 cents; there is no subharmonic there — f0/2 sits at
    -115 dB);
  - a render that CLIPPED yields plausible-but-wrong spectral numbers (-6032
    cents on a 440 Hz tone) with nothing in the output to say so.

So the measurement instrument is itself an instrument, and this one is calibrated
before it is trusted: `--selftest` renders signals whose f0, colour and comb
contrast are known in advance and asserts the meter returns them. Run it whenever
this file, `backend/lco_write.py`'s host scaffold, or the Csound version changes.
A number from an uncalibrated meter is not evidence.

The scaffold is DERIVED from `lco_write._HEAD`/`_TAIL` by substitution, and every
substitution is asserted to match exactly once — so a rename in the real host
fails this harness loudly instead of quietly measuring a different instrument.
What is measured is `asig`, the body's own output, before the host's `kgate *
kpresGain * HEADROOM` and its final `clip`.

    """The authored body inside the REAL host, driven offline.

    glide=(f0, f1) sweeps the note's pitch exponentially over its whole length,
    which is how a body's behaviour across the keyboard gets measured in one
    render instead of twenty.

    preroll runs the instrument for that many seconds BEFORE the note, and the
    audio is trimmed back to the note. It matters more than it looks, because at
    preroll=0 this harness does not reproduce the host:

      the host scores `i 1 0 2000000000 <voice>` — sixteen instances, always on since
      the plugin loaded, notes signalled through `ktrig`/`kgate`
      this harness scores `i 1 0 <dur> 1` — the instance BEGINS at the note

    So at preroll=0 every piece of state that is not note-relative starts fresh at
    note-on, which in the plugin it never does. Two classes of body are measured
    wrongly, and both were shipped that way:

    - `balance`. Its RMS denominator starts at zero, so a body whose source builds
      from silence gets an enormous gain for the first milliseconds. `string` reads
      a true peak of 3.18 at 4.4 ms here and 0.19 with `balance` replaced by a fixed
      gain; in the plugin the estimator has been settled for as long as the plugin
      has been open. Two entries were reported as clipping on that artefact.
    - a free-running LFO. `tanpura` claims to be the one entry in the library whose
      spectrum climbs after the attack, via `khal poscil 0.5, 0.27`. At preroll=0 the
      3.70 s cycle starts at phase 0 exactly at note-on and the climb always appears.
      In the plugin the phase at note-on is the plugin's uptime mod 3.70 s: at a
      quarter turn the same note DARKENS. A body meant to behave a certain way over
      its note must key that behaviour to `knote`, which the host does reset.

    preroll stays 0.0 by default so that the recorded calibration keeps meaning what
    it says. `lco_axis_probe.gate` sweeps it on any body that contains a free-running
    k-rate oscillator, which is where the difference decides anything.

    A SECOND difference from the plugin is open and is not addressed here: the RATE.
    Since `5e65c0d4` the engine compiles Csound at `sampleRate x factor` (1/2/4, a
    Settings control since `667d8bea`) and decimates each voice back with a 63-tap
    halfband FIR, so `%SR%` in the plugin resolves to the oversampled rate. This
    harness substitutes `sr = 44100` unconditionally. Two consequences, both real:

    - a body that derives its own bandwidth from `sr` — `tanpura`'s `kmax = int(sr *
      0.45 / kf0)`, `fm_ep`'s tine-ratio cap — gets a different Nyquist here than in
      the plugin, so its partial count is measured at the most conservative setting
      the player can choose;
    - ALIASING is invisible to every meter in this file, because folding happens at
      the rate the generators are computed at and that rate is not this one.

    Nothing here is calibrated for that, and it must not be faked by resampling in
    Python: the plugin's decimator is a specific filter, and a second, different one
    would produce numbers that look like the plugin's and are not. The measurement
    that exists for it is `tools/audition_lro_oversampling.cpp`, on the real engine.

    """Loudness travelling INSIDE one held note, in dB, with the decay taken out.

    `rms_db` averages the whole note and `sustain` compares its ends, so between them
    they see a level that is wrong and a level that drifts — and neither sees a level
    that MOVES and comes back. `overtone_voice` at `press` 0 stepped -12.1 -> -15.4 ->
    recover -> -9.5 -> recover over a held note, 6.08 dB peak to peak, and the crossed
    gate passed it at a 0.33 dB spread because every corner's MEAN was steady. §4 of
    `LCO_CONCEPT.md` lets the colour travel over a note and not the loudness, so that
    was an invariant violation with no meter pointed at it.

    The envelope is read in dB and LINEARLY DETRENDED before the peak-to-peak is taken,
    which is what makes one number work for a standing tone and a struck one alike: an
    exponential decay is a straight line in dB, so detrending removes it exactly and
    leaves what the decay does not explain. A struck body therefore reads small here
    even though its `sustain` is 0.001.

    Calibrated on signals whose answer is known — a steady tone reads 0.02 dB, a clean
    exponential decay over 60 dB reads 0.16, and an asked 3.00 dB of 2 Hz tremolo reads
    3.00 — and on the library, where the honest floor is set by noise: a 50 ms window on
    white noise has about 0.13 dB of RMS scatter, so an unmodulated bed lands near 0.8
    and bodies whose SUBSTANCE is amplitude events (`rain`, `crackle`, `thunder`) land
    far above that and are not defects.

    The first second is skipped: an attack is not travel.

    THE SPAN ALONE DOES NOT SAY WHETHER THE BODY IS AT FAULT — read it with
    `loudness_is_the_body`. A narrow filter fed noise has a fluctuating envelope by
    construction, and the narrower it is the wilder that gets: with NOTHING whatever
    modulating it, `mode aex, 880, Q` measured 5.86 dB at Q 10, 14.92 at Q 200 and
    18.43 at Q 700, and 24.14 at Q 700 over twelve seconds instead of four. A
    `butterbp` of 1 Hz reads 20.11. A deliberate 3.00 dB tremolo on a wide band reads
    4.88 — LESS than any of them. So on every narrowband body in this library the span
    is dominated by Rayleigh statistics, it grows with the note's length, and a bare
    figure like "15 dB" is a statement about the filter's bandwidth and not about the
    design. Figures for `fm_bell`, `glass`, `struck_bar` and every mode bank were
    published from this before the split existed and meant nothing.

    THE DETREND IS A BLIND SPOT AND `loudness_drift_db` IS THE OTHER HALF. A straight
    line in dB is removed exactly, which is the point for a decay and a hole for
    everything else: a note that fades 6 dB or SWELLS 20 dB from beginning to end reads
    0.00 here, and §4 names exactly that ("a tone that fades to silence on its own is
    not"). Read the two together or the monotone class is invisible.

    Returns None, not 0.0, when it could not measure — a note too short for four windows
    or one with fewer than four windows above the floor. Those used to return 0.0, which
    is what a clean steady tone returns, so "declined to measure" and "measured no
    travel" were the same number: a 1.1 s note with 12 dB of tremolo in it read 0.00.

    `loudness_travel`'s span cannot answer this and neither can anything computed from

    noise realisation and a noise envelope is nothing but the realisation: so render the
    same body with different seeds and correlate the dB envelopes. Returns the median
    pairwise correlation, or None when the body has no reseedable source.

    The null is measured, not assumed: 50 bare resonances over Q 10..2000, two pitches

    sits above the largest reading noise alone produced, the same way `moves` sets its
    own threshold. Above it, the body is doing it.

    ITS POWER IS NOT ABSOLUTE, and that is the honest limit: this measures how much of
    the span the modulation OWNS, so a modulation buried under the body's own envelope
    fluctuation cannot be seen. Measured over 60 tremolos of 0.5..6 dB at 0.3..5 Hz, the
    median reading is +0.892 on a 400 Hz band, +0.681 on 100 Hz and +0.193 on 10 Hz —
    on a band that narrow even 6 dB is invisible, because the envelope's own span there
    is about 13 dB. At 3 dB or more on a band of 100 Hz or wider the minimum is +0.836.

    So: ABOVE the threshold is proof, BELOW it is "not demonstrated", never "innocent".
    Two independent reasons for that asymmetry, both measured. A modulation whose RATE
    comes from the PITCH also decorrelates — the first version of this test compared
    pitches rather than seeds and read `overtone_voice`'s real 6.66 dB step pump as
    -0.03, because the harmonic it steps through is chosen from the pitch. And a body

    `verdict` is whichever fits better by more than 0.1, else "mixed" — the honest
    answer for something like a fixed formant set over a tracking glottal source,

    objective signature — where the colour goes, and how far — so "it moves" stops
    being a matter of what somebody remembers hearing.

    The window length picks which RATE of motion is visible, and reading only one
    of them will call a moving instrument still: `pwm`'s duty sweep reads 48 Hz of
    travel in 0.5 s windows (n=8, a full LFO cycle per window, averaged flat) and
    696 Hz in 31 ms ones (n=128). A standing sine reads 0 at every window length,
    which is what makes the fast reading evidence rather than noise. `measure()`
    therefore reports both.

    Tracked on `centroid_audible`, not `centroid`: this is a claim about whether the

    carry that claim. The span this returns is therefore NOT comparable with the

    nothing modulating it reads 830 Hz of travel at n=128, more than most of the
    genuinely moving entries, while a standing sine reads 0.4. So a movement test
    built on the span alone passes every noise bed in the library and would certify
    "movement by default" on a body that provably cannot move.

    What separates them is the SHAPE of the centroid track, not its range: a track

    only variance spreads it over all of them. So this is one minus the spectral
    flatness of the track — 1 for a track that moves at some definite rate, 0 for
    white wandering, and free of any assumption about WHICH rate.

    It was the lag-1 autocorrelation, which is the same idea done cheaply, and the
    cheapness cost real answers. Lag-1 on an n=128 track over 4 s samples the track
    at 32 Hz, and the autocorrelation of a component at rate f is cos(2*pi*f/32) —
    which is exactly ZERO at 8 Hz and NEGATIVE above it. A wineglass whose two

    Two sources a few cents apart beat, and that beat is the whole substance of a

    meter can see it — the spectrum is the same whether the partials beat or not,
    so `centroid`, `comb_contrast` and `travel` all read a musette axis as doing
    almost nothing (measured: `bagpipe`'s detune moved the centroid by 1 Hz over
    its whole range while the beat rate went from 1.0 to 4.0 Hz). Judging such an
    axis by colour alone concludes it is inert and invites deleting it.

    Read off the rectified signal at the FULL sample rate, as the largest spectral
    component in the beat band relative to the mean level, so `depth` comes out on
    the same scale as an asked-for AM depth. Calibrated against exactly that:
    asked 0.00 / 0.10 / 0.30 / 0.60 read 0.000 / 0.100 / 0.300 / 0.600.

    The full rate is not an optimisation, it is the correctness of the whole meter.
    Rectifying a tone at f0 puts a ripple at 2*f0 (at f0 itself, for an asymmetric
    waveform) into the envelope. This used to be block-averaged to 200.455 Hz, which
    ALIASES that ripple straight into the beat band, and the block average is a
    boxcar whose rejection at 110 Hz is only 0.574 — nowhere near enough to stop it.
    Measured on plain unmodulated sines, with nothing whatever modulating them:
    55 Hz read a beat of depth 0.372 at 90.39 Hz (the 110 Hz ripple folded about
    200.455) and 110 Hz read 0.052 at 19.68 Hz (220 folded to 19.55). The second one
    landed inside the NARROW 25 Hz band too, and at 0.052 it was within reach of the
    0.05 spread the audit's M6 treats as a real rate control, so no choice of band was
    ever going to fix it. (M6 thresholds the spread ACROSS an axis's anchors, not one
    absolute depth, so a constant fabrication like this one does not pass M6 on its
    own — it fabricates the baseline every anchor is then read against.)
    At the full rate nothing folds: the ripple stays at 2*f0 where it belongs.

    `f0_hz` closes the other half. A component at or above the fundamental is not a
    beat — it is a sideband, and the spectral meters already see it — so the band is
    capped just below the fundamental when the caller knows it. Unmodulated sines then
    read 0.000 at every register instead of 0.372, and an asked 0.30 at 90 Hz reads
    0.300 rather than the 0.200 the boxcar's roll-off left of it.

    `f0_hz` is the fundamental this signal ACTUALLY has, not the pitch that was asked
    for, and the difference is the whole point: an entry that plays an octave below the
    asked note has its own ripple at the asked pitch, so a cap derived from the ask
    excludes nothing. Measured at an asked 220 Hz — `bass_saw` sounds 109.9 and read a
    beat of 0.434 at 110.0 Hz, `sub_sine` 0.372 at 110.0, `organ` 0.145 at 110.67, and
    `bagpipe`, which sounds two octaves down, 0.213 at 109 Hz. None of those bodies modulates anything
    near those rates; `bass_saw`'s only LFO is at 0.043 Hz. Off the measured
    fundamental they read 0.019 / 0.020 / 0.084 / 0.212 — and bagpipe's is its real
    drone beat, at 2.33 Hz, which is what this meter was written for.

    The cap is 2 Hz below the fundamental and not half of it, because half throws away
    a whole octave of genuine beat: an asked 0.30 at 115 Hz on a 220 Hz carrier read
    0.003 at the half-cap and reads 0.300 now, `didgeridoo`'s 97 Hz vocal hum went from
    0.155 to 0.533 at a 110 Hz note, and `sax`'s 74 Hz growl from nothing to its own
    line. 2 Hz is six bins of the 3 s window against a Hann main lobe two bins wide,
    which is what it takes to keep the fundamental's own line out.

    `at_hz` asks about ONE rate instead of the strongest, because the strongest hides
    the others. A rubbed wineglass has two independent amplitude motions at once —
    the two quadrupole modes beating, and the finger passing four antinodes a lap —
    and searching for the maximum reported only the beat, at a depth that did not
    budge when the pulsation axis was swept from 0 to 1. The instrument then reads
    as inert on exactly the axis it is named for. Calibrated on a sum of two AMs
    where one is deliberately the louder: asked 0.30 at 3 Hz alongside 0.45 at
    9 Hz, `at_hz=3` reads 0.299 while the plain call reports the 9 Hz line.

    It has one limit, and it is not small: a STRONGER line within about a hertz
    leaks in and is reported instead. Measured, a 0.45-deep line at a distance of
    0.4 / 0.8 / 1.2 / 1.6 Hz makes `at_hz=4.6` read 0.400 / 0.350 / 0.021 / 0.000 —
    so the answer is trustworthy from roughly 1.2 Hz of separation onward and is
    simply the neighbour below that. This is the window's own resolution and no
    choice of band fixes it; 3 s at 200 Hz gives 0.33 Hz bins and a Hann main lobe
    two bins wide. The glass harp is exactly the case that found it: asking about
    its 4.6 Hz pulsation returned 0.23 at the pulsation depth of ZERO, because its
    3.4 Hz beat sits one bin below the band edge. If two rates are that close, they
    are one measurement, and the axis must be judged by colour instead.

    The resolution is set by the window in SECONDS and not by the envelope rate, so
    it is unchanged by reading at the full rate: 3 s gives 0.33 Hz bins either way.

    # `cricket`'s chirp runs at 31 Hz and reads 0.033 at 24.00 Hz capped against 0.401

    # 0.064 against 0.187, `didgeridoo`'s 97 Hz hum 0.059 against 0.158. The cap's rule
